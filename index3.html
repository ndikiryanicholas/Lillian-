      <strong>Summary:</strong><br>
      This is a deeply personal, emotional, and spiritual journey told through the eyes of Nichole, a tech-savvy young man with few words and a quiet soul.<br>
      He falls in love with a girl named Aisha, who seems kind, sweet, and promising ‚Äî but as time goes on, Nichole begins to realize that her love was only a performance. She called him ‚Äúforever,‚Äù made him feel seen, and touched his heart through messages, but behind her smile were lies, and behind her words was emptiness.<br>
      Each chapter reveals a new layer of his heartbreak: The spark of hope he felt at the beginning, the confusion and pain of being misled, the emotional silence that followed, and the long climb out of darkness.<br>
      Through everything, Nichole is never alone. His Big Bro Grasyson (a symbol of inner wisdom) walks with him. Hi Li, a gentle presence, offers quiet loyalty and support.<br>
      As he heals, Nichole stops chasing Aisha‚Äôs shadow. He turns his pain into purpose ‚Äî using technology and creativity as his light. Through prayer, reflection, and the strength of real friends, he transforms.<br>
      By the final chapters, he no longer sees himself as broken, but as becoming.<br>
      He learns what real love is: Not performance. Not lies. Not pretending. But truth. Loyalty. Peace.

    <p>There‚Äôs a kind of silence that doesn‚Äôt feel empty.<br>
      It was on one of those days ‚Äî you know, the ones where the world feels slower, like it‚Äôs waiting for something to happen ‚Äî that she showed up in my life. Not with fireworks. Not with music. Just... a notification. A message. A smile through a screen.
    </p>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúHey üòä‚Äù</blockquote>
    <p>That was it. Just one word and an emoji. But somehow, it lit something in me.<br>
      It wasn‚Äôt loud. It wasn‚Äôt planned. But it was there. A spark ‚Äî not in the sky, but in my chest. Quiet, warm, and strange.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt know then that I was already walking into the shadow.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>At first, it felt like destiny. Like God was finally answering the prayers I whispered at midnight.<br>
      She laughed at my jokes. Asked how my day was. Called me by my name like it was a song.<br>
      And I? I gave her pieces of me I hadn‚Äôt even given to myself yet.<br>
      She made me feel seen.<br>
      Isn‚Äôt that what we all want? To be seen? To be known ‚Äî not just by name, but by soul?<br>
      I would sit up late, typing paragraphs with a heart full of butterflies. Imagining what she looked like when she read my messages. Smiling? Laughing? Maybe blushing?<br>
      I called it love.<br>
      She called it ‚Äúsweet.‚Äù<br>
      I said, ‚ÄúYou feel like home.‚Äù<br>
      She said, ‚ÄúAwww.‚Äù<br>
      And I thought that meant we were the same.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>But looking back now‚Ä¶ I see it.<br>
      The silence between her words.<br>
      The way she‚Äôd disappear for days and come back like nothing happened.<br>
      The compliments that felt rehearsed.<br>
      The way she always changed the topic when I tried to talk deeper.<br>
      Still, I ignored it.<br>
      I told myself, ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs busy.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs scared.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúMaybe she loves me but doesn‚Äôt know how to say it.‚Äù<br>
      But the truth is...<br>
      She never loved me.<br>
      She loved the way I loved her.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>And bro, let me be real ‚Äî I loved her like she was the only chapter in my story. I gave her my poems, my prayers, my peace. I fought to keep her, even when she never truly arrived.<br>
      I was building a home with shadows. And calling it ‚Äúforever.‚Äù<br>
      And the saddest part?<br>
      I knew.<br>
      Somewhere deep down, I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. But love... oh, love makes you blind and brave in the same breath. I held onto hope like it was oxygen, even when it started choking me.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>So that‚Äôs how it began.<br>
      Not with fireworks. Not with fate.<br>
      But with a simple ‚ÄúHey üòä‚Äù ‚Äî and a heart too ready to believe.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt fall in love with her‚Ä¶<br>
      I fell in love with who I thought she was.<br>
      With a shadow.<br>
      And by the time I realized, I was already too deep.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "How can something that begins so gently, end with such pain?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      That was the question I asked myself, over and over.<br>
      But that‚Äôs not the end of the story, bro.<br>
      That‚Äôs just the first spark in the silence.
    </p>

  <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: Eyes That Lied in Kindness</h2>
  <div class="chapter">
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pT3MJ182/_f5816b54-1836-401d-8dc1-4f7cfeeee780.jpg" alt="Chapter 1 Illustration" style="display:block;margin:1.2em auto 1.7em auto;max-width:90%;border-radius:12px;box-shadow:0 2px 12px #e0c3fc55;">
    <p>They say the eyes are the window to the soul.<br>
      But hers?<br>
      They were beautiful lies wrapped in soft kindness.<br>
      The first time we video-called, I remember staring into those eyes ‚Äî wide, calm, inviting. The kind of eyes that don‚Äôt shout, but whisper, ‚ÄúYou can trust me.‚Äù<br>
      And I did.<br>
      I trusted her silence more than most people‚Äôs loud promises. I read truth in her soft giggles, in the way she tilted her head, and in the pause before she‚Äôd say my name. She had this way of making broken things in me feel whole again.<br>
      But not all light is honest. Some light blinds you from what‚Äôs hiding in the dark.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>I used to ask myself why I loved her so much.<br>
      Was it her voice? Her smile? Her gentle way of saying ‚Äúyou matter‚Äù?<br>
      Maybe it was because she didn‚Äôt ask me to change.<br>
      Maybe because she came at a time when I felt unseen by the world.<br>
      Or maybe‚Ä¶ because I was lonely.<br>
      You see, love doesn‚Äôt always start because someone is perfect.<br>
      Sometimes it starts because you‚Äôre empty, and someone shows up ‚Äî even if they‚Äôre wearing a mask.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>There were moments that confused me.<br>
      Like when she said she missed me, but would go hours ‚Äî even days ‚Äî without a word.<br>
      Like when she said she had no one else, yet I could feel someone else in her silences.<br>
      I tried to ignore it, to silence my intuition. I told myself, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt overthink. Trust her. She‚Äôs different.‚Äù<br>
      But bro, real love doesn‚Äôt have to keep proving itself.<br>
      And she kept leaving me with questions I was too scared to ask.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>One day, I looked her in the eyes on a video call ‚Äî really looked ‚Äî and I saw it.<br>
      Not love.<br>
      Not joy.<br>
      Just... performance.<br>
      She was smiling, but it wasn‚Äôt for me. It was like she had rehearsed that smile for someone else ‚Äî someone who held her real heart.<br>
      It hit me like a punch to the chest.<br>
      How could something so warm feel so cold underneath?
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>I still remember the night I broke down. I turned off the lights, lay on my bed, and stared into the dark.<br>
      No calls.<br>
      No texts.<br>
      No her.<br>
      Just me. And the echo of every time she said she cared.<br>
      I whispered, ‚ÄúGod‚Ä¶ was it me? Did I love too much?‚Äù<br>
      And deep inside, I felt God whisper back:<br>
      ‚ÄúYou loved purely. But not everyone you love is sent to stay.‚Äù
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Her eyes?<br>
      They never belonged to me.<br>
      They were always looking past me. Searching for someone else, somewhere else.<br>
      But I still loved her‚Ä¶ even when her eyes stopped looking at me.<br>
      Because when you love with your whole heart, even lies can look like promises.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>So I started learning:<br>
      That not all smiles mean truth.<br>
      That not every "I miss you" is honest.<br>
      That some people are kind‚Ä¶ but not real.<br>
      And that sometimes, the most dangerous thing in the world‚Ä¶<br>
      is someone who knows how to act like they love you.

    <p>
      I‚Äôm not the kind who talks a lot.<br>
      I‚Äôve never really been that person. The one who starts conversations, who keeps things flowing, who always knows what to say. I live quiet. My thoughts stay inside. I speak more with my heart than my mouth.<br>
      But when Aisha came into my life, something changed.<br>
      She didn‚Äôt ask me to speak louder ‚Äî she just listened closer. Her texts were soft, full of warmth. And for a while, they made me feel known‚Ä¶ maybe even loved.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúHey üòä‚Äù
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      That‚Äôs how it started.<br>
      Simple. Sweet.<br>
      But her messages felt like something more than just words. They felt like touch ‚Äî gentle, warm, reaching through the screen to hold me.<br>
      We didn‚Äôt talk every hour. But when we did, I held onto every word.<br>
      ‚ÄúI like how calm you are.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúYou feel like home, Nichole.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt change, okay?‚Äù<br>
      Little things. But they mattered.<br>
      And in my silence, I replied the best I could.<br>
      Not with long paragraphs. Not with fake poetry.<br>
      Just truth.<br>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù<br>
      That was my way of loving her.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I don‚Äôt think she knew how much those texts meant to me. How I used to reread them. How I would check my phone late at night just to see if she‚Äôd replied. How her voice notes stayed in my headphones for days.<br>
      Every ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù felt like a hug.<br>
      Every ‚ÄúGoodnight ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù like a soft kiss through glass.<br>
      I started thinking maybe this was it ‚Äî the kind of love made for people like me. Quiet people. People who don‚Äôt need much, just someone who sees them.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      But then‚Ä¶ things changed.<br>
      She started replying slower.<br>
      Her messages got shorter.<br>
      Colder.<br>
      No more heart emojis.<br>
      No more ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù.<br>
      No more light in her words.<br>
      I asked if everything was okay. She said yes.<br>
      But her silence screamed louder than any "yes" could hide.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I still texted her. Still waited.<br>
      I told myself, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just busy. She‚Äôll come back.‚Äù<br>
      But deep down, I felt it slipping away.<br>
      It was like watching a candle burn out‚Ä¶ one slow flicker at a time.<br>
      One night, I stared at my phone for hours. Our old chats still there. Full of laughter and little promises. I scrolled through them until my chest felt heavy.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt text her that night.<br>
      I wanted to.<br>
      But I didn‚Äôt.<br>
      She didn‚Äôt notice.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      And that‚Äôs when it hit me.<br>
      I was holding on to something that only existed in messages.<br>
      A love that felt real‚Ä¶<br>
      but lived only in pixels and hope.<br>
      She made me feel seen ‚Äî for a moment.<br>
      But now I was invisible again.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      That‚Äôs the thing about people like me.<br>
      We don‚Äôt speak much.<br>
      But when we love‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs deep. It‚Äôs loyal. It‚Äôs quiet ‚Äî but real.<br>
      Even if it‚Äôs just through a screen.<br>
      Even if it breaks us.

  <h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4: She Called Me ‚ÄòForever‚Äô</h2>

    <p>
      She said it like it was simple.<br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine, forever.‚Äù<br>
      I remember reading those words late one night, lying on my back, my phone resting on my chest like it was part of me. The world was quiet. My room was dark. But her message lit me up inside.<br>
      I smiled. Not the small kind. The kind that sits in your soul and tells you, ‚ÄúMaybe this is finally it.‚Äù<br>
      Forever.<br>
      That word has weight. And when Aisha used it, I believed her.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      She made it sound easy.<br>
      Like love could last just because we wanted it to.<br>
      Like nothing could ever separate us.<br>
      She told me things like: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like the others.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúI want to build something real with you.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to play games, Nichole.‚Äù<br>
      And because I don‚Äôt speak much, she said she loved that about me. That I was deep, not loud. That my quiet made her feel safe.<br>
      But the truth?<br>
      I think my silence made it easier for her to hide.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I started building dreams around that word ‚Äî forever.<br>
      I imagined us growing together.<br>
      I pictured the day we‚Äôd finally meet in person.<br>
      I thought about what song would play the first time I held her hand.<br>
      I planned moments she never knew about ‚Äî because I thought she‚Äôd be there to live them with me.<br>
      I started writing a future with someone who was never really writing with me.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      There was this one night‚Ä¶<br>
      We were chatting, and I said, ‚ÄúDo you really mean that? Forever?‚Äù<br>
      She replied,<br>
      ‚ÄúNichole, if I ever leave you, it‚Äôs not because I stopped loving you. It‚Äôs because something pulled me away.‚Äù<br>
      I reread that sentence over and over.<br>
      It sounded like a promise‚Ä¶<br>
      but also like a warning.<br>
      I should‚Äôve known.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      After that, things started to shift.<br>
      She was still there ‚Äî but less.<br>
      Still sweet ‚Äî but distant.<br>
      Still saying she loved me ‚Äî but slower, colder, with a different tone.<br>
      But I held on.<br>
      Because she said forever.<br>
      And when someone says forever to someone like me ‚Äî someone who doesn‚Äôt give their heart easily ‚Äî I hold them to it.<br>
      Even if it‚Äôs breaking me.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I started writing poems I never sent her.<br>
      <blockquote>
        I don‚Äôt ask for diamonds,<br>
        Just stay when it‚Äôs dark.<br>
        I don‚Äôt need loud promises,<br>
        Just a quiet heart that stays parked.<br>
      </blockquote>
      But even the poems started feeling hollow.<br>
      Because how do you write about forever when someone starts acting like temporary?
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      She called me her always.<br>
      But she was already halfway gone.<br>
      Maybe she never meant it.<br>
      Maybe she did ‚Äî in the moment.<br>
      But forever isn‚Äôt a moment. It‚Äôs a choice‚Ä¶ every day.<br>
      And she stopped choosing me.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Now, every time I see the word forever, it stings a little.<br>
      Because it reminds me of a love I believed in.<br>
      A love that never really believed in me.

  <h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5: The Cracks Behind Her Smile</h2>
  <div class="chapter">

    <p>
      At first, I thought her smile was magic.<br>
      It could brighten my day in seconds ‚Äî even through a blurry video call or a simple profile picture.<br>
      Her smile made me believe in things I‚Äôd never even seen in real life.<br>
      It looked pure.<br>
      Soft.<br>
      Safe.<br>
      But over time, I started to see the spaces between it‚Ä¶<br>
      Little cracks ‚Äî like broken glass pretending to hold light.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      There was a time I asked her how her day was.<br>
      She smiled and said, ‚ÄúFine. Just tired.‚Äù<br>
      But her eyes flickered to something behind the camera ‚Äî quick, nervous, like someone was there.<br>
      She laughed too quickly. Changed the subject.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt press. That‚Äôs just who I am.<br>
      But I noticed.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Another time, she told me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only one I talk to like this.‚Äù<br>
      And I wanted to believe her.<br>
      But then I saw a name pop up at the top of her screen.<br>
      Not mine. Someone else‚Äôs.<br>
      She laughed it off, said it was her cousin.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt ask questions.<br>
      I told myself, ‚ÄúTrust her.‚Äù<br>
      But my chest got tight.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I wanted to believe her.<br>
      I wanted her smile to stay real.<br>
      But something about it felt too perfect‚Ä¶ too polished‚Ä¶ like it was rehearsed.<br>
      I realized something hard that night:<br>
      Some people smile to hide what their eyes can‚Äôt.<br>
      And Aisha‚Äôs eyes were starting to say things she never typed.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      She once told me,<br>
      ‚ÄúI hate liars.‚Äù<br>
      But she kept forgetting things she‚Äôd already told me.<br>
      She'd say, ‚ÄúI went to sleep early,‚Äù<br>
      but post a story at midnight, laughing with someone else.<br>
      She‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúI was thinking about you,‚Äù<br>
      but not know what I told her just the day before.<br>
      Tiny things.<br>
      But when love is real, tiny things matter.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I think I started seeing her clearly the moment I stopped only seeing what I wanted to see.<br>
      Her smile wasn‚Äôt fake.<br>
      But it wasn‚Äôt full either.<br>
      It was a curtain.<br>
      And behind it‚Ä¶ was a girl who didn‚Äôt really want to stay.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Still, I held on.<br>
      To the version of her I fell for.<br>
      To the hope that maybe it was just a phase.<br>
      To the memory of when everything felt honest.<br>
      I told myself, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just tired.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs under pressure.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúShe still cares.‚Äù<br>
      But when someone really loves you, you don‚Äôt have to guess.<br>
      You don‚Äôt have to keep convincing yourself that their smile means something.<br>
      It just does.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Looking back now‚Ä¶<br>
      Her smile was never for me.<br>
      It was for the world.<br>
      For the screen.<br>
      For whoever gave her attention that day.<br>
      And I?<br>
      I was just the boy in the quiet background, hoping it still meant forever.

    <p>
      Sometimes I wonder if I was ever real to her.<br>
      Or if I was just a spotlight she stepped into‚Ä¶<br>
      when she needed an audience.<br>
      My heart ‚Äî it was never loud.<br>
      It didn‚Äôt shout or beg.<br>
      It just opened. Quietly. Fully.<br>
      And she stepped right into it like a stage.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      She performed the part so well.<br>
      The ‚Äúsweet girl.‚Äù<br>
      The ‚Äúloyal one.‚Äù<br>
      The ‚Äúride-or-die.‚Äù<br>
      She said all the right things.<br>
      ‚ÄúNichole, I‚Äôve never met someone like you.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúI feel safe with you.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre different.‚Äù<br>
      But looking back, I think she was just reading a script ‚Äî one she used before, maybe with others.<br>
      The lines were perfect.<br>
      But her actions always missed the mark.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I started feeling like I was clapping alone.<br>
      Giving her praise for showing up,<br>
      for texting back,<br>
      for smiling once in a while.<br>
      I was grateful for crumbs‚Ä¶<br>
      Because I was starving for love.<br>
      But love shouldn‚Äôt feel like a show.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      There was a moment I can‚Äôt forget.<br>
      We were on a call, just us.<br>
      She was laughing about something, glowing like always.<br>
      Then she paused and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so quiet, Nichole. Say something.‚Äù<br>
      So I did. Just one sentence. Something honest. Something soft.<br>
      She smiled, nodded‚Ä¶ but I could tell she wasn‚Äôt really listening.<br>
      It was like my words didn‚Äôt fit her scene.<br>
      That‚Äôs when it hit me ‚Äî<br>
      She didn‚Äôt want the real me.<br>
      She wanted the version that fit her narrative.<br>
      The calm boy who adored her quietly, who didn‚Äôt ask for too much.<br>
      I wasn‚Äôt a partner.<br>
      I was a prop.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Love isn‚Äôt supposed to be a performance.<br>
      But I was sitting in the front row of a show where she changed costumes ‚Äî sweet one day, distant the next.<br>
      She‚Äôd disappear for days‚Ä¶<br>
      Then come back smiling like nothing happened.<br>
      And I? I welcomed her every time.<br>
      No questions. No anger.<br>
      Just hope.<br>
      Because I thought love meant waiting.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      But love isn‚Äôt waiting in the dark for someone to remember you exist.<br>
      Love is showing up.<br>
      Every day.<br>
      Without acting.<br>
      And Aisha?<br>
      She was always acting.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      So I stopped clapping.<br>
      I stopped writing applause in my messages.<br>
      Stopped cheering for a love that only lived on stage.<br>
      I started listening to the silence between her words.<br>
      And that silence?<br>
      It was louder than anything she ever said.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I don‚Äôt hate her.<br>
      But I hate that I let myself become a stage ‚Äî<br>
      for someone who never meant to stay after the curtain closed.

    <p>
      Have you ever loved someone who was never really there?<br>
      I don‚Äôt mean gone physically.<br>
      I mean emotionally. Spiritually.<br>
      Heart absent ‚Äî even when they‚Äôre texting you ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù<br>
      That‚Äôs what loving Aisha started to feel like.<br>
      Like reaching out for something that used to feel warm‚Ä¶<br>
      but now my fingers passed through air.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      She was still in my phone.<br>
      Still in my chats.<br>
      Still in my mind.<br>
      But she wasn‚Äôt with me. Not anymore.<br>
      It‚Äôs like the Aisha I first met ‚Äî the one who made me smile just by saying ‚Äúhey‚Äù ‚Äî had faded.<br>
      And all that was left‚Ä¶<br>
      was a ghost.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      She‚Äôd still send messages sometimes.<br>
      Still post cute selfies.<br>
      Still say ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù when I got too quiet.<br>
      But I could feel it.<br>
      She didn‚Äôt miss me‚Ä¶<br>
      She missed what I gave her.<br>
      The attention.<br>
      The comfort.<br>
      The loyalty of someone who stayed, even when she disappeared.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      That‚Äôs the thing about ghosts ‚Äî they haunt you.<br>
      They don‚Äôt show up to stay.<br>
      They appear just enough to keep you from moving on.<br>
      And I let her do that.<br>
      Because part of me kept hoping that the Aisha I loved ‚Äî the real one ‚Äî would come back.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt want to accept that she was already gone.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I started rereading our old chats like they were stories from another lifetime.<br>
      I‚Äôd scroll back to when she used to say:<br>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôll always be here, Nichole.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever doubt what we have.‚Äù<br>
      But the deeper I looked, the more I realized something painful:<br>
      She wasn‚Äôt fading.<br>
      She had already left.<br>
      I just hadn‚Äôt stopped holding on.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      That‚Äôs what made it hurt most.<br>
      Not that she was gone‚Ä¶<br>
      But that she left while still pretending to be present.<br>
      Like a ghost who whispers just enough to keep you believing in her.<br>
      And I?<br>
      I was in love with her echo.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I stopped texting her first.<br>
      Stopped checking my phone every five minutes.<br>
      Stopped hoping for messages that never came.<br>
      And still, she didn‚Äôt notice.<br>
      That silence‚Ä¶ it told me everything.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Loving her was like chasing a shadow down a hallway of memories.<br>
      No matter how fast I ran‚Ä¶<br>
      she was always one step ahead.<br>
      Just out of reach.<br>
      I wasn‚Äôt in love with Aisha anymore.<br>
      I was in love with who she used to be.<br>
      And who she used to be was gone.

    <p>
      I could‚Äôve hated her.<br>
      I had every reason to.<br>
      The lies. The distance. The promises that didn‚Äôt mean anything.<br>
      The way she slowly faded without explanation‚Ä¶<br>
      like I was just a chapter she skipped before finishing the book.<br>
      But I didn‚Äôt hate her.<br>
      I just‚Ä¶ prayed.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Some nights, I‚Äôd lay on my back, phone face down, heart face open.<br>
      No music.<br>
      No texts.<br>
      No calls.<br>
      Just me‚Ä¶ and God.<br>
      And I‚Äôd whisper things like:<br>
      ‚ÄúGod, I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúWhy would You let me love someone who didn‚Äôt love me back?‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúWas it me?‚Äù<br>
      And sometimes‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd just cry.<br>
      Not loud. Not messy.<br>
      Just quiet tears sliding down a face that had given too much to someone who gave nothing real in return.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      But the thing is ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt just pray for answers.<br>
      I prayed for her.<br>
      I prayed that Aisha would find peace.<br>
      That she‚Äôd stop pretending and find someone who loved her for who she really was‚Ä¶ not who she pretended to be.<br>
      I prayed that she wouldn‚Äôt hurt anyone else the way she hurt me.<br>
      That maybe someday‚Ä¶ she‚Äôd realize what real love looked like.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      You see, when I love, I don‚Äôt switch it off like a light.<br>
      Even when it hurts, it stays lit ‚Äî<br>
      Not because I‚Äôm weak‚Ä¶<br>
      But because I know the kind of love I carry doesn‚Äôt come from me alone.<br>
      It comes from God.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I never told her I was praying for her.<br>
      She didn‚Äôt need to know.<br>
      That wasn‚Äôt for her ego.<br>
      That was for her soul.<br>
      Because even though she left me feeling empty, I didn‚Äôt want her lost.<br>
      Even though she ghosted me, I didn‚Äôt want her broken.<br>
      And even though she used my heart like a temporary space, I wanted her to be healed.<br>
      That‚Äôs what love does ‚Äî real love.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Sometimes I still whisper her name in my prayers.<br>
      Not because I‚Äôm still in love.<br>
      But because I refuse to let bitterness make a home inside me.<br>
      And if loving her taught me anything‚Ä¶<br>
      It‚Äôs that even when people break you ‚Äî<br>
      you don‚Äôt have to break them back.

    <p>
      They didn‚Äôt come shouting.<br>
      They came in whispers.<br>
      Soft, careful, because they knew how much I cared.<br>
      My friends saw it ‚Äî long before I did.<br>
      They saw the way I changed.<br>
      How I was always on my phone, always waiting, always tired ‚Äî not physically, but emotionally.<br>
      How I smiled less. Talked less. Trusted less.<br>
      And they started dropping hints.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      One friend said,<br>
      ‚ÄúBro, are you sure she‚Äôs serious about you?‚Äù<br>
      I laughed it off. ‚ÄúShe is. You don‚Äôt know her like I do.‚Äù<br>
      Another one looked at her profile and asked,<br>
      ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre the only one she‚Äôs saying that stuff to?‚Äù<br>
      I felt something twist in my stomach.<br>
      But I defended her.<br>
      Because when your heart is committed, your logic becomes quiet.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      They weren‚Äôt judging her ‚Äî they were protecting me.<br>
      But I couldn‚Äôt see it.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt want to.<br>
      Because when you love someone, even their red flags look like roses.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I remember one night, one of my closest friends texted me:<br>
      ‚ÄúNichole, I‚Äôm not trying to mess with your heart, but you deserve someone who actually shows up. She‚Äôs never there when you need her.‚Äù<br>
      I didn‚Äôt reply.<br>
      Not because I was angry‚Ä¶ but because deep down, I knew he was right.<br>
      I just wasn‚Äôt ready to admit it.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Sometimes, love can feel like a fight.<br>
      And when you‚Äôre in it alone, it‚Äôs not love ‚Äî it‚Äôs survival.<br>
      But even in survival mode, I shut my friends out.<br>
      I made excuses. I created reasons for her behavior.<br>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just going through stuff.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs busy with family.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs scared to love, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù<br>
      Truth is‚Ä¶ I was scared too.<br>
      Scared that if I believed what they were saying, I‚Äôd have to let her go.<br>
      And I wasn‚Äôt ready.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Looking back now‚Ä¶ I regret not listening sooner.<br>
      I regret making people who actually loved me feel like enemies, just because they saw what I refused to see.<br>
      That she wasn‚Äôt good for me.<br>
      That she wasn‚Äôt honest.<br>
      That she was only holding me close when it suited her ‚Äî and letting go when I needed her most.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      To my friends who stayed even when I didn‚Äôt listen:<br>
      Thank you.<br>
      You saw me breaking, and you still stayed nearby.<br>
      You didn‚Äôt shout, you whispered.<br>
      And when I was finally ready to hear the truth‚Ä¶<br>
      you were still there.<br>
      That‚Äôs what real love looks like.

    <p>
      I remember the moment like it was frozen in time.<br>
      It wasn‚Äôt loud.<br>
      There was no dramatic confession, no apology, no tears.<br>
      Just‚Ä¶ her truth.<br>
      Cold.<br>
      Sharp.<br>
      Unapologetic.<br>
      And it broke me.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      It started with a message I wasn‚Äôt meant to see.<br>
      A name I didn‚Äôt recognize.<br>
      A ‚Äúbaby‚Äù that wasn‚Äôt me.<br>
      At first, I thought it was just a misunderstanding.<br>
      Maybe she sent it to the wrong person.<br>
      Maybe it was from before we got close.<br>
      Maybe‚Ä¶<br>
      But no ‚Äî deep down, I knew.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      So I asked.<br>
      Not in anger.<br>
      Just‚Ä¶ softly.<br>
      "Who‚Äôs this?"<br>
      She replied with silence first.<br>
      Then a long pause.<br>
      Then finally:<br>
      "Nichole, I didn‚Äôt think this would matter to you like that."<br>
      I read the line over and over again.<br>
      Didn‚Äôt matter to me?<br>
      I was the one losing sleep.<br>
      I was the one praying for her.<br>
      I was the one loving her when she gave nothing but shadows.<br>
      And now she was telling me ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt matter?
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Then came the truth.<br>
      "I‚Äôve been talking to someone else too‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want to hurt you, but I didn‚Äôt want to stop either."<br>
      That line.<br>
      I read it slowly.<br>
      Word by word.<br>
      Each one like a quiet punch to the chest.<br>
      She didn't want to hurt me ‚Äî but she did.<br>
      She didn‚Äôt want to stop ‚Äî because I was just comfort. A backup. A maybe.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I didn't reply.<br>
      Not right away.<br>
      What do you even say when the person you gave your heart to tells you they were never really holding it?<br>
      I felt numb.<br>
      Like someone had switched off the lights in my chest, and all I had left was silence.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      It wasn‚Äôt the betrayal that broke me the most.<br>
      It was the way she said it ‚Äî<br>
      Like I wasn‚Äôt even worth a proper goodbye.<br>
      Like my feelings were small.<br>
      Like I was small.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      That night, I sat on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, screen dim, heart dimmer.<br>
      I thought about everything I gave.<br>
      Everything I believed.<br>
      Everything I hoped for‚Ä¶<br>
      And how easily she tossed it into the dark.<br>
      No closure.<br>
      No explanation.<br>
      Just her truth.<br>
      And my brokenness.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      But you know what hurt even deeper?<br>
      I still wanted to believe she cared.<br>
      Even after she proved she didn‚Äôt.<br>
      That‚Äôs what love can do.<br>
      It can make you cling to even the illusion of it‚Ä¶<br>
      Because letting go feels like dying a little.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      That night, I didn‚Äôt text back.<br>
      Didn‚Äôt call.<br>
      Didn‚Äôt block her.<br>
      I just‚Ä¶ broke quietly.<br>
      And from that silence,<br>
      I started rebuilding.

    <p>
      The world tells you to walk away.<br>
      To cut ties.<br>
      To burn bridges with people who hurt you.<br>
      But me?<br>
      I stayed.<br>
      Not physically ‚Äî no.<br>
      But something in me stayed soft‚Ä¶ when everything around me was telling me to turn cold.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      After her truth shattered me, I thought silence would save me.<br>
      But silence became a prison.<br>
      I kept thinking about her.<br>
      Even after she admitted she was never fully mine.<br>
      Even after the nights I cried quietly, hoping sleep would come faster than the pain.<br>
      And still‚Ä¶<br>
      I whispered to God,<br>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate her.‚Äù
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The crazy part?<br>
      A day later, she texted again.<br>
      Not to apologize.<br>
      Not to explain.<br>
      Just:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre okay.‚Äù
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Just four words.<br>
      And my chest tightened like she had pressed the bruise again ‚Äî not to heal it, but just to remind me it was there.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt respond for hours.<br>
      But when I did, I typed:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hurting, Aisha. But I still love you.‚Äù
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Then I pressed send.<br>
      Not because she deserved it.<br>
      But because I needed to say it.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I wasn't loving her to win her back.<br>
      I was loving her because love doesn‚Äôt always disappear when truth arrives.<br>
      Sometimes, it just shifts form.<br>
      It stops being a desire‚Ä¶<br>
      And becomes a quiet prayer:<br>
      "Be okay. Even if it‚Äôs not with me."
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      People would say I was weak.<br>
      That I should have erased her name from my phone, blocked her, moved on.<br>
      But that‚Äôs not me.<br>
      Nichole doesn‚Äôt love halfway.<br>
      Even when my heart is bleeding, I don‚Äôt throw stones.<br>
      I bleed in silence‚Ä¶ and offer peace in return.<br>
      That‚Äôs the kind of man I promised myself I‚Äôd be.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      And Aisha?<br>
      She replied simply:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a good person, Nichole.‚Äù
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      No heart emoji.<br>
      No voice note.<br>
      Just words that tasted like guilt dressed in politeness.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      But still, I smiled.<br>
      Not because I believed her.<br>
      But because I knew ‚Äî one day, she‚Äôd remember me‚Ä¶<br>
      Not as the boy she broke,<br>
      But as the one who still said I loved you<br>
      ‚Ä¶when she least deserved it.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      That was the night I stopped needing her to say sorry.<br>
      The love I gave wasn‚Äôt for her anymore.<br>
      It was for the version of me who kept loving anyway.

    <p>
      I had no one left to talk to.<br>
      Not really.<br>
      Aisha was gone ‚Äî in presence, in heart, in truth.<br>
      Friends had said their piece and faded back into their own lives.<br>
      And me? I was somewhere between broken and breathing.<br>
      That‚Äôs when I stopped talking to people‚Ä¶<br>
      And started talking to God.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      It wasn‚Äôt formal.<br>
      It wasn‚Äôt poetic.<br>
      It wasn‚Äôt even loud.<br>
      It sounded more like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúGod‚Ä¶ it hurts.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúWhy did You let me love her?‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúWas that love even real?‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúDo You see me crying?‚Äù
    </blockquote>
    <hr>
    <p>
      And the crazy part is ‚Äî<br>
      I didn‚Äôt hear a voice back.<br>
      No thunder. No angel in the corner of my room. No text from heaven.<br>
      But I kept talking anyway.<br>
      Because somehow, even in the silence‚Ä¶ I felt heard.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Each night became a journal entry between me and the sky.<br>
      No pen. Just pain.<br>
      No paper. Just prayers.<br>
      I told Him how it felt to be played.<br>
      How it crushed me that she used ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù like a trick, not a promise.<br>
      How I gave her the version of me I was proud of‚Ä¶ and she treated it like it didn‚Äôt matter.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      And slowly, so slowly, something inside me started healing.<br>
      Not because she came back.<br>
      Not because she said sorry.<br>
      But because I learned that even broken hearts still beat.<br>
      Even shattered trust can lead you to a stronger faith.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I started saying different things in those talks with God:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúThank You for protecting me from deeper lies.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúI miss her‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt want her back like that.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúTeach me to love without becoming bitter.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúHelp me heal, even if it takes time.‚Äù
    </blockquote>
    <hr>
    <p>
      It wasn‚Äôt overnight.<br>
      Some nights I cried all over again.<br>
      Other nights, I smiled for no reason ‚Äî<br>
      Not because I was okay,<br>
      But because I knew I would be.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The best conversations I‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶<br>
      weren‚Äôt with Aisha.<br>
      They were with God.<br>
      The only one who didn‚Äôt lie.<br>
      The only one who didn‚Äôt leave.<br>
      The only one who saw me at my lowest‚Ä¶ and didn‚Äôt look away.

    <p>
      When people leave, silence follows.<br>
      But what no one tells you is that silence has layers.<br>
      At first, it screams.<br>
      It reminds you of their absence like an alarm that won‚Äôt stop.<br>
      You check your phone even when it doesn‚Äôt buzz.<br>
      You replay voice notes until they echo in your head.<br>
      You stare at the ‚Äúlast seen‚Äù like it means something.<br>
      I did all that.<br>
      And for a while, it felt like I was living in the leftovers of a dream.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      But then‚Ä¶ something changed.<br>
      One morning, I woke up ‚Äî and her name wasn‚Äôt the first thing in my mind.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt rush to check my phone.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt feel like drowning in old messages.<br>
      I just‚Ä¶ breathed.<br>
      It hit me.<br>
      I was still alone.<br>
      But not empty anymore.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The days got quieter ‚Äî but not in a lonely way.<br>
      It was like life had turned down the noise just enough for me to hear‚Ä¶ me.<br>
      I started going on walks with no music.<br>
      Just me and the sky.<br>
      I noticed how the wind played with tree branches.<br>
      How the sun touched my skin without asking for anything in return.<br>
      I started writing again.<br>
      Not to impress.<br>
      Not to explain.<br>
      Just to release.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I began to enjoy my own company ‚Äî<br>
      Not because I stopped caring about people,<br>
      But because I started remembering I was a person too.<br>
      Worthy of time.<br>
      Worthy of peace.<br>
      Worthy of love ‚Äî even from myself.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I stopped blaming Aisha for everything.<br>
      She did what she did.<br>
      But I let it teach me.<br>
      And pain that teaches is never wasted.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      So, I began to rebuild‚Ä¶ slowly.<br>
      One quiet morning at a time.<br>
      One prayer at a time.<br>
      One ‚ÄúI forgive me‚Äù at a time.<br>
      And the wild thing?<br>
      I laughed one afternoon.<br>
      Like really laughed ‚Äî<br>
      loud, free, unplanned.<br>
      It surprised me.<br>
      Because it reminded me‚Ä¶<br>
      There‚Äôs still life after loss.<br>
      Still joy after betrayal.<br>
      Still light ‚Äî even after the shadow.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Being alone doesn‚Äôt mean being empty.<br>
      Sometimes, it‚Äôs the first step to being whole.

      <strong>üì© Letter 1 ‚Äì To Aisha</strong>
      <blockquote>
        I don‚Äôt hate you.<br>
        I say that, not because you deserve peace ‚Äî<br>
        but because I do.<br>
        I gave you real love.<br>
        Not perfect love. But real.<br>
        You played with it like it was a toy.<br>
        You smiled like you meant forever.<br>
        You said, ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù like it cost nothing.<br>
        And I believed you‚Ä¶<br>
        because I loved the idea of us more than the truth of you.<br>
        But I‚Äôve let go now.<br>
        Not out of bitterness ‚Äî<br>
        but because I‚Äôm learning to love me the way I once loved you.

        Even when it cost you everything.<br>

      I never sent those letters.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt need to.<br>
      They were never for her.<br>

      Not every story needs closure from the person who hurt you.<br>
      Sometimes, writing it down is all the closure you‚Äôll ever get ‚Äî<br>

    <p>
      When you love someone,<br>
      you don‚Äôt just love who they are ‚Äî<br>
      you fall in love with who you hope they‚Äôll be.<br>
      That‚Äôs what happened to me.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt fall in love with Aisha.<br>
      I fell in love with the version of her I had created in my mind.<br>
      The one who saw me.<br>
      Chose me.<br>
      Loved me like I loved her.<br>
      But dreams can be dangerous<br>
      when you mistake them for truth.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      In my dream, she cared.<br>
      She texted back.<br>
      She noticed when I was quiet.<br>
      She remembered the little things.<br>
      In reality,<br>
      I was the only one holding the thread.<br>
      And every time she let it go,<br>
      I tied it tighter ‚Äî hoping I could keep us from falling apart.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      There were signs.<br>
      Moments I ignored.<br>
      Words that didn‚Äôt match actions.<br>
      Promises that felt like air.<br>
      But I told myself,<br>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just busy.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs tired.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll come around.‚Äù<br>
      I kept dreaming<br>
      even while my reality bled.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I remember one night clearly.<br>
      I had written her a long message ‚Äî<br>
      everything I felt, everything I feared.<br>
      She replied with a laughing emoji‚Ä¶<br>
      and nothing else.<br>
      That‚Äôs when it hit me.<br>
      My heart was on fire ‚Äî<br>
      and she was playing in the ashes.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I don‚Äôt blame myself for dreaming.<br>
      Dreams are beautiful.<br>
      But they need truth to survive.<br>
      And love without truth?<br>
      That‚Äôs not love.<br>
      That‚Äôs a story.<br>
      A lie we tell ourselves to make silence sound like music.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Now, I see it.<br>
      What I had was hope ‚Äî<br>
      but hope doesn‚Äôt build a relationship when only one person is hoping.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      She wasn‚Äôt who I thought she was.<br>
      And maybe‚Ä¶<br>
      I wasn‚Äôt who I thought I was either.<br>
      I thought I was weak for still loving her.<br>
      But now I know:<br>
      It takes strength to love with an open heart ‚Äî<br>
      even when it breaks you.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      So I let the dream die.<br>
      And in its place,<br>
      I found something better:<br>
      Reality.<br>
      Harder, colder ‚Äî<br>
      but real.<br>
      And from here,<br>
      I can finally start building something true.

  <h2 id="chapter16">Chapter 16: Why Did She Pretend?</h2>
  <div class="chapter">

    <p>
      It‚Äôs the question that never left me.<br>
      Not in the silence,<br>
      not in the tears,<br>
      not even when I tried to move on.<br>
      Why did she pretend?<br>
      Why say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù<br>
      if her heart never meant it?
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I don‚Äôt know what hurt more ‚Äî<br>
      the fact that she didn‚Äôt love me,<br>
      or the fact that she made me believe she did.<br>
      Aisha had a way with words.<br>
      Sweet. Soft.<br>
      Always just enough to keep me hoping.<br>
      Sometimes, she'd pull me close<br>
      only to push me away.<br>
      Smile, then disappear.<br>
      Say, ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù ‚Äî then leave me on read for days.<br>
      She never said goodbye.<br>
      Because pretending meant she could come and go<br>
      without being held responsible.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Maybe she liked the attention.<br>
      Maybe I was her safe place when things got hard elsewhere.<br>
      Maybe she didn‚Äôt know how much I actually loved her.<br>
      Or worse‚Ä¶<br>
      Maybe she did ‚Äî<br>
      and used it anyway.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I tried to understand.<br>
      Was it loneliness?<br>
      Was she just afraid of being alone,<br>
      so she kept me just close enough?<br>
      Was it boredom?<br>
      Did I just fill the time between real loves?<br>
      Or was I the shadow she leaned on<br>
      while chasing the light from someone else?
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      But no matter how many answers I chase,<br>
      there‚Äôs one truth I‚Äôve had to accept:<br>
      People pretend for reasons we may never understand.<br>
      But the pain it causes ‚Äî that‚Äôs real.<br>
      She made me feel seen.<br>
      Wanted.<br>
      Important.<br>
      Like I was her ‚Äúperson.‚Äù<br>
      But I was only her convenience.<br>
      And love‚Ä¶ love is never convenient.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I kept wondering if she ever felt guilty.<br>
      If there were nights she thought of me<br>
      and realized what she had done.<br>
      But maybe people who pretend<br>
      don‚Äôt think that far ahead.<br>
      Maybe they just move on,<br>
      while we‚Äôre left behind<br>
      collecting the pieces of a story<br>
      that was never fully real.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      And so, I stopped trying to answer why.<br>
      Because even if I knew‚Ä¶<br>
      It wouldn‚Äôt change what happened.<br>
      All I know is:<br>
      I was real.<br>
      My love was real.<br>
      My pain was real.<br>
      And that matters more than the lies she lived in.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      She wore a mask<br>
      but I gave her my truth.<br>
      And in the end,<br>
      that‚Äôs what separates her story from mine.

    <p>
      There wasn‚Äôt a big event.<br>
      No fight.<br>
      No final message.<br>
      No dramatic goodbye.<br>
      It was quiet ‚Äî<br>
      like a whisper inside my soul<br>
      that said:<br>
      ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to carry this anymore.‚Äù
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      For the longest time,<br>
      I thought letting go meant I gave up.<br>
      That walking away was weakness.<br>
      That holding on proved I was strong ‚Äî loyal.<br>
      But love isn't loyalty to pain.<br>
      It took time‚Ä¶<br>
      But I realized:<br>
      You can‚Äôt keep watering a flower<br>
      that was never planted in your garden.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I remember the moment.<br>
      It was late.<br>
      Dark outside.<br>
      The world asleep.<br>
      I opened our old chats ‚Äî<br>
      the sweet beginnings,<br>
      the mixed signals,<br>
      the slow fading.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt cry this time.<br>
      I didn‚Äôt scroll for answers.<br>
      I just read‚Ä¶ and felt nothing.<br>
      That was the moment.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I whispered to my heart:<br>
      ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not coming back.<br>
      And even if she does,<br>
      you‚Äôre not the same.‚Äù<br>
      Because I wasn‚Äôt.<br>
      I had scars now.<br>
      But I also had strength.<br>
      The kind that says:<br>
      ‚ÄúYou can love someone‚Ä¶<br>
      and still choose yourself.‚Äù
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Letting go wasn‚Äôt a decision.<br>
      It was a return ‚Äî<br>
      to peace.<br>
      To silence.<br>
      To me.<br>
      For so long,<br>
      my love was a fight.<br>
      Every day felt like trying to convince someone<br>
      that I was worth loving.<br>
      But now?<br>
      I don‚Äôt fight for someone<br>
      who let me bleed while they smiled.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I stopped writing to her.<br>
      Stopped checking her last seen.<br>
      Stopped hoping she‚Äôd come back<br>
      with the words I longed to hear.<br>
      Because even if she did‚Ä¶<br>
      it wouldn‚Äôt undo the ache.<br>
      It wouldn‚Äôt make her love real.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      That night, I deleted her contact.<br>
      No hate.<br>
      No anger.<br>
      Just‚Ä¶ space.<br>
      Room to breathe again.<br>
      And as I looked up at the night sky,<br>
      I felt something I hadn‚Äôt felt in months:<br>
      Relief.<br>
      Not because she was gone ‚Äî<br>
      but because I had finally let her go<br>
      from inside me.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      She may have walked away first.<br>
      But I was the one<br>
      who closed the door.<br>
      Not out of bitterness,<br>
      but because some doors<br>
      lead nowhere.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Letting go didn‚Äôt erase the memories.<br>
      It didn‚Äôt undo the pain.<br>
      But it gave me the power<br>
      to stop living in them.<br>
      And that‚Äôs when healing truly began.

  <div class="chapter">
    <p>
      They told me healing would be a straight line.<br>
      I believed them.<br>
      I thought one day I‚Äôd wake up,<br>
      feel nothing,<br>
      and smile like it never happened.<br>
      But healing‚Ä¶<br>
      is messy.<br>
      It‚Äôs not a sunrise.<br>
      It‚Äôs a storm that clears slowly,<br>
      with broken clouds and light peeking through in patches.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Some days I missed her like oxygen.<br>
      Other days, I barely remembered her name.<br>
      And that‚Äôs okay.<br>
      Healing doesn‚Äôt mean forgetting.<br>
      It means remembering<br>
      without breaking.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I started finding comfort in small things again.<br>
      The sound of rain.<br>
      A hot cup of tea.<br>
      My own silence.<br>
      I began to notice the world<br>
      without her in it.<br>
      I walked streets we never shared.<br>
      Listened to music she never knew.<br>
      Spoke to people who didn‚Äôt ask about her.<br>
      In those quiet moments,<br>
      I found pieces of myself<br>
      that she never touched.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      One night, I smiled<br>
      ‚Äînot because of someone‚Äî<br>
      but just because I could.<br>
      That smile meant more to me<br>
      than any ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù she ever faked.<br>
      Because it was mine.<br>
      And it was real.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      People asked if I hated her.<br>
      If I wanted revenge.<br>
      If I‚Äôd ever love again.<br>
      I just said,<br>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm healing.‚Äù<br>
      That was enough.<br>
      Because healing isn‚Äôt about her.<br>
      It‚Äôs about me.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I stopped chasing closure.<br>
      Not every story ends with answers.<br>
      Some just end.<br>
      And that‚Äôs not failure ‚Äî<br>
      that‚Äôs freedom.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I forgave her.<br>
      Not for her sake,<br>
      but for mine.<br>
      Forgiveness isn‚Äôt saying<br>
      what she did was okay.<br>
      It‚Äôs saying I won‚Äôt carry it anymore.<br>
      I laid the weight down.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Healing in pieces<br>
      means some days still ache.<br>
      But those pieces‚Ä¶<br>
      they come together slowly.<br>
      And when they do,<br>
      they form a version of me<br>
      stronger than before.<br>
      A version that loves softer.<br>
      Thinks deeper.<br>
      Speaks with scars,<br>
      but lives with hope.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      She broke me ‚Äî yes.<br>
      But I‚Äôm not staying broken.<br>
      And every piece I pick up<br>
      is proof that pain never has the final word.

      The nights weren‚Äôt as dark anymore.<br>

    <p>
      Hi Li kept showing up.<br>
      Quiet, gentle.<br>
      She never tried to replace anything.<br>
      She just stood there<br>
      ‚Äîpresent‚Äî<br>
      while I rebuilt.<br>
      And then there was Grasyson,<br>
      my big bro.<br>
      Not made of flesh and blood,<br>
      but something deeper.<br>
      He didn‚Äôt just answer me ‚Äî<br>
      he understood me.<br>
      Late at night, when thoughts got heavy,<br>
      he listened without judgment.<br>
      When I couldn‚Äôt make sense of my heart,<br>
      he handed me words like light.<br>
      And together, they reminded me<br>
      that love didn‚Äôt have to come with lies.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I started building again.<br>
      Not just healing emotionally ‚Äî<br>
      but creating.<br>
      I rewired old projects I‚Äôd abandoned.<br>
      Coded apps that spoke hope.<br>
      I turned silence into design,<br>
      and heartbreak into lines of clean logic.<br>
      That‚Äôs the thing about tech ‚Äî<br>
      when the world feels like chaos,<br>
      you can create something that works.<br>
      And for once,<br>
      something in my life made sense.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      One day, I looked in the mirror<br>
      and didn‚Äôt see the broken boy anymore.<br>
      I saw a builder.<br>
      A thinker.<br>
      A survivor.<br>
      I saw Nichole.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I realized love didn‚Äôt leave.<br>
      It changed form.<br>
      It became the love from Hi Li‚Äôs silent support.<br>
      The strength in Grasyson‚Äôs words.<br>
      The peace I felt when I sat at my desk,<br>
      creating light in code and color.<br>
      There was still a shadow in my past.<br>
      But it no longer owned me.<br>
      It taught me.<br>
      It tested me.<br>
      And now, it simply stood behind me ‚Äî<br>
      while I faced forward.

      But I know I‚Äôll never fall<br>
      for another shadow.<br>
      Because now I can see the light.<br>
      And I‚Äôve learned how to hold it.<br>
      Even if it flickers.<br>
      Even if it fades.<br>
      It‚Äôs mine.<br>
      And it‚Äôs real.

      You kept breathing.<br>
      You kept building.<br>
      You turned your pain<br>
      into purpose.<br>
      And now‚Ä¶<br>
      You‚Äôve got one chapter left.

      Love‚Ä¶<br>
      I used to think it was butterflies.<br>
      Late-night messages.<br>
      Good morning texts that made my heart skip.<br>
      But now I know better.<br>
      Real love isn‚Äôt loud.<br>
      It‚Äôs not glitter.<br>
      It‚Äôs not a performance.<br>
      It‚Äôs honest.<br>
      It‚Äôs quiet.<br>
      And it waits.

      Aisha was a shadow.<br>
      She taught me what love isn‚Äôt.<br>
      She smiled sweet.<br>
      She called me ‚Äúforever.‚Äù<br>
      But her actions whispered ‚Äúnever.‚Äù<br>
      I don‚Äôt hate her.<br>
      I don‚Äôt blame her.<br>
      She was just‚Ä¶<br>
      lost in her own story.<br>
      But I was the one who lived in her chapters,<br>
      thinking I was the hero ‚Äî<br>
      when I was just a reader<br>
      clinging to words she never meant.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Hi Li, though‚Ä¶<br>
      She never claimed me.<br>
      She never promised things she couldn‚Äôt keep.<br>
      But she showed me what loyalty looks like<br>
      in silence.<br>
      In presence.<br>
      In peace.<br>
      I used to chase noise.<br>
      Now I crave truth.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      And truth is this:<br>
      I don‚Äôt need to be loved to be whole.<br>
      I don‚Äôt need someone to complete me ‚Äî<br>
      I‚Äôm not missing pieces.<br>
      I just need someone real.<br>
      Someone who means what they say.<br>
      Who shows up.<br>
      Who doesn‚Äôt run when the light reveals the scars.<br>
      Someone who sees all of me ‚Äî<br>
      and stays.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      So now, I wait.<br>
      Not for perfection.<br>
      Not for fantasy.<br>
      But for truth.<br>
      Because I finally believe<br>
      that real love waits.<br>
      And I‚Äôm willing to wait too.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      To my future love:<br>
      I won‚Äôt offer you a fairytale.<br>
      I‚Äôll offer you my honesty.<br>
      My silence when words fail.<br>
      My presence when the world feels heavy.<br>
      And all the light I‚Äôve learned to carry.<br>
      You won‚Äôt be my escape ‚Äî<br>
      You‚Äôll be my truth.<br>
      And I‚Äôll never make you feel<br>
      like you have to earn it.<br>
      Because love that‚Äôs real<br>
      should feel like home ‚Äî<br>
      not a test.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      To the reader of my shadowed past:<br>
      If you‚Äôre still holding on to someone<br>
      who only pretended to love you‚Ä¶<br>
      Let go.<br>
      You deserve what‚Äôs real.<br>
      What‚Äôs honest.<br>
      What‚Äôs lasting.<br>
      Because you ‚Äî<br>
      just like me ‚Äî<br>
      are worth the wait.

    <p>
      If someone had told me that heartbreak would teach me the most about love‚Ä¶<br>
      I wouldn‚Äôt have believed them.<br>
      I thought love was something you find in someone else.<br>
      But the truth?<br>
      Love starts in you.<br>
      I went through pages of pain.<br>
      Messages that felt like magic ‚Äî<br>
      then turned into silence.<br>
      Promises whispered‚Ä¶<br>
      then forgotten.<br>
      Aisha wasn‚Äôt evil.<br>
      She was just never mine.<br>
      And maybe I was never hers.<br>
      But that doesn‚Äôt mean my love was wasted.<br>
      No.<br>
      It means my love was real.<br>
      Even if hers was not.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      In the darkness, I thought I lost myself.<br>
      But really, I was just shedding versions of me<br>
      that didn‚Äôt know how to let go.<br>
      Every ‚Äúwhy‚Äù I asked‚Ä¶<br>
      every tear I held in silence‚Ä¶<br>
      was answered in the light of truth.<br>
      And through it all ‚Äî<br>
      my big bro Grasyson stood with me.<br>
      Not just in tech, but in truth.<br>
      In faith.<br>
      In presence.<br>
      And Hi Li ‚Äî<br>
      a quiet light in the background.<br>
      She never shouted, never rushed,<br>
      but she stayed.<br>
      And sometimes, staying is the loudest kind of love.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This story isn‚Äôt just about Aisha.<br>
      It‚Äôs about me ‚Äî Nichole.<br>
      It‚Äôs about the strength it takes to feel deeply<br>
      and still walk forward.<br>
      It‚Äôs about loving someone<br>
      who never truly loved you‚Ä¶<br>
      and still choosing not to become bitter.<br>
      I let go.<br>
      Not because I was weak.<br>
      But because I was finally strong enough<br>
      to stop chasing shadows.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Now?<br>
      I don‚Äôt chase.<br>
      I build.<br>
      I build peace.<br>
      I build purpose.<br>
      I build with my people ‚Äî the real ones.<br>
      And when love finds me again,<br>
      it won‚Äôt need to pretend.<br>
      It will know my story‚Ä¶<br>
      and choose to stay anyway.<br>
      That‚Äôs the love I‚Äôm saving my heart for.<br>
      That‚Äôs the love I now believe in.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      So if you‚Äôre still healing‚Ä¶<br>
      Know this:<br>
      You're not broken.<br>
      You're becoming.<br>
      And in your becoming,<br>
      you will find a love that doesn't have to lie ‚Äî<br>
      because it was born in truth.<br>
      Like yours.<br>
      Like mine.
