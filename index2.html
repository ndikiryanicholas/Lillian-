  <blockquote>
    Some people walk into your life like sunlight… but she walked in like starlight—quiet, distant, and beautiful. And I… I was just the night sky.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I didn’t know what it meant to feel everything and nothing at the same time… until I saw Hi Li.<br>
    She was standing across the school compound, her long dark hair being gently pulled by the wind like the world itself wanted to touch her. She didn’t look around like the rest of us. She didn’t need to. The world looked at her.<br>
    Hi Li was elegance without effort. Grace in silence.<br>
    Even from that distance, I knew: she wasn’t just another pretty face.<br>
    She was a whole different universe.<br>
    And I...<br>
    I was just Nichole—a quiet boy from a noisy world, a shadow learning how to survive the light.

    <h2>✨ EPILOGUE: After the Last Bell</h2>
    <blockquote>Some stories don’t end. They echo.</blockquote>
    <p>
      Years have passed since that rooftop night.<br>
      Hi Li is now a full nurse — healing people, one quiet miracle at a time.<br>
      And me?<br>
      I’m still building.<br>
      Still coding.<br>
      Still listening to the voice of that downtown boy who once whispered, “Maybe I can.”<br><br>
      HiCare expanded faster than I dreamed.<br>
      We partnered with clinics, schools, and even other young developers who once felt like I did — invisible but full of light.<br>
      We built something real.<br>
      And not just on screens…<br>
      But in hearts.<br>
      <br>
      Me and Hi Li?<br>
      We’re not perfect.<br>
      We argue about small things — like which music to play in the car, or how late I stay up working. 😅<br>
      But we laugh louder now.<br>
      We hold each other tighter.<br>
      We don’t need the world to approve.<br>
      Because we already chose each other.<br>
      <br>
      And Grayson?<br>
      He’s still here.<br>
      That voice, my guide, my constant reminder that no one makes it alone.<br>
      He’s the Big Bro in my story — the proof that sometimes, the best friendships are felt in the silences between the words.<br>
      <blockquote>
        “I believed in you before the world did,” he always said.<br>
        “And I still do.”
      </blockquote>
      <br>
      If you’re holding this book in your hands —<br>
      It means the story made it.<br>
      We made it.<br>
      Not because everything turned out perfect…<br>
      But because we kept going.<br>
      Even when it hurt.<br>
      Even when no one clapped.<br>
      Even when we felt alone.<br>
      We kept showing up.<br>
      For the dream.<br>
      For each other.<br>
      For love.<br>
      <br>
      So wherever you are —<br>
      Downtown or Uptown, broken or bold, full of pain or full of hope…<br>
      Remember:<br>
      Your light is real.<br>
      Your story matters.<br>
      And the best part?<br>
      It’s just getting started.<br>
      <br>
      🖤 For the dreamers.<br>
      💙 For the quiet ones.<br>
      ✨ For the ones who never gave up.<br>
      This was our story.<br>
      And now…<br>
      It’s yours.<br>
