        Some people walk into your life like sunlight… but she walked in like starlight—quiet, distant, and beautiful. And I… I was just the night sky.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I didn’t know what it meant to feel everything and nothing at the same time… until I saw Hi Li.<br>
        She was standing across the school compound, her long dark hair being gently pulled by the wind like the world itself wanted to touch her. She didn’t look around like the rest of us. She didn’t need to. The world looked at her.<br>
        Hi Li was elegance without effort. Grace in silence.<br>
        Even from that distance, I knew: she wasn’t just another pretty face.<br>
        She was a whole different universe.<br>
        And I...<br>
        I was just Nichole—a quiet boy from a noisy world, a shadow learning how to survive the light.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        They called her “the Up-Town Girl.”<br>
        Not just because she lived in the rich part of the city, but because everything about her seemed... elevated.<br>
        She didn’t walk. She floated.<br>
        She didn’t speak. She sang with her voice—even when reading a math answer.<br>
        Hi Li came from the part of town where people drink water in wine glasses.<br>
        Where birthdays look like movie scenes.<br>
        Where they don’t ask about your dreams—they give you the money to chase them.<br>
        And me?<br>
        I come from the part where you iron your uniform with a charcoal iron.<br>
        Where lunch isn't guaranteed, but faith is.<br>
        Where silence teaches you how to hope.<br>
        We were never supposed to meet.<br>
        And if we did… we weren’t supposed to connect.<br>
        But life doesn’t always follow maps.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        That day she looked at me—just once.<br>
        One second.<br>
        But enough to stop time inside my chest.<br>
        She didn’t smile. She didn’t blink.<br>
        But her eyes met mine, and my whole world shifted.<br>
        No one noticed. No one saw.<br>
        But for me, that moment became a memory—burned into my heart like a candle in a dark room.<br>
        I kept asking myself, "Why would she look at me?"<br>
        There was nothing to see.<br>
        But maybe... just maybe...<br>
        She saw the one thing nobody ever bothered to see: The darkness.<br>
        And maybe she knew, like I did, that stars shine because of the darkness—not despite it.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        That night, I didn’t sleep.<br>
        Not because I had fallen in love.<br>
        But because for the first time… someone made me feel like I existed.<br>
        Not just to breathe.<br>
        But to be seen. To matter.<br>
        Hi Li didn’t know me yet.<br>
        But I had already started writing poems in my heart about her.<br>
        And maybe, just maybe…<br>
        That was the beginning of something neither of us expected.

        “She had everything I never had… and still, I wanted nothing else but her smile.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The next few days, I tried not to look at her.<br>
        But my heart betrayed me every time.<br>
        Every time I heard laughter near the school fountain, I looked.<br>
        Every time the wind carried the smell of vanilla and roses, I looked.<br>
        And every time the morning sun bounced off something too shiny for this place…<br>
        I knew Hi Li had arrived.<br>
        She always came with quiet footsteps, like she didn’t want the world to notice her—but the world noticed anyway.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Hi Li didn’t sit with us in the main class blocks.<br>
        She had her own small group—quiet, elegant, full of perfumes and polished nails.<br>
        They spoke softly, and when they laughed, it was like a melody that didn’t belong in our dusty compound.<br>
        And then there was me.<br>
        I sat at the back. Always at the back.<br>
        With my shoes dusty, my shirt slightly faded, and my books worn from being handed down.<br>
        She was the page in the magazine.<br>
        I was the newspaper used to wrap food.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        But here’s the thing, bro...<br>
        Sometimes, we admire people from a distance not because we are afraid of them…<br>
        But because we’re afraid of what we feel when we’re close to them.<br>
        I didn’t know her favorite song.<br>
        I didn’t know if she believed in love.<br>
        I didn’t know if she noticed how the world shifted every time she smiled.<br>
        But I knew this: I wanted to know her.<br>
        Not just her name or her school marks.<br>
        I wanted to know how she saw the world.<br>
        Did she believe in stars like I did?<br>
        Did she ever feel alone in a crowd?
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        One afternoon, during break, I found myself near the staffroom window, pretending to read notes. She passed by.<br>
        Alone.<br>
        No friends. No noise.<br>
        And for the first time… she stopped.<br>
        Looked at me. Again.<br>
        This time, it was longer. A full three seconds.<br>
        Like the universe paused just so my heartbeat could speak.<br>
        “Hi,” she said.<br>
        Bro.<br>
        She said “Hi.”<br>
        It wasn’t a song. It wasn’t poetry.<br>
        It was just a small word.<br>
        But from her lips—it sounded like the beginning of a miracle.<br>
        I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.<br>
        Just air.<br>
        She smiled. Just a little. A soft one.<br>
        And walked away.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I stood there frozen. Not because I was scared—but because something inside me had shifted.<br>
        Maybe, just maybe…<br>
        This Up-Town Girl didn’t care where I came from.<br>
        Maybe she wasn’t just beauty in the clouds.<br>
        Maybe she was searching too.<br>
        Searching for someone who didn’t want her for her money, or her looks, or her status…<br>
        …but someone who just wanted to know her heart.<br>
        And maybe—just maybe—that someone was me.

        “She smiled at me… and my silence grew louder than ever before.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After that day, nothing felt the same.<br>
        Not the school compound, not the sky, not even the way my name sounded in the register.<br>
        One word from her—“Hi”—and my world started speaking in colors I never knew existed.<br>
        But I didn’t tell anyone.<br>
        Not my classmates. Not my brothers at home.<br>
        Not even the pages in my notebook that I usually trusted with my secrets.<br>
        Because this wasn’t just a crush.<br>
        This was the beginning of something… sacred.<br>
        Something I was afraid to touch in case it disappeared.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Every time I saw Hi Li after that moment, my chest would tighten.<br>
        She wasn’t trying to impress anyone. She never chased attention.<br>
        But she had mine—completely.<br>
        Sometimes she sat under the tree near the library, writing in a black notebook.<br>
        I wondered what she wrote.<br>
        Were they poems? Dreams? Memories?<br>
        Was I one of them now?<br>
        Other times, she’d lean her head on her hand and just stare out the window like she missed someone or something far away.<br>
        And I would just sit there… watching, wondering, wishing.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I wanted to talk to her again.<br>
        I wanted to say more than just “Hi” back.<br>
        But every time I had the chance… I froze.<br>
        There was a fear I couldn’t explain.<br>
        Not of her—but of the voice in my head whispering:<br>
        “You’re not enough.”<br>
        “She’ll never choose someone like you.”<br>
        “You’re just a background character in her story.”<br>
        That voice was loud.<br>
        Louder than my courage.<br>
        And so… I stayed silent.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        One day, during library hour, the unexpected happened.<br>
        Hi Li dropped her pen. It rolled all the way to my feet.<br>
        She looked at me—gently, patiently.<br>
        And I picked it up and walked toward her.<br>
        My hands were sweating. My heart was begging me to speak.<br>
        But when I handed her the pen… I just nodded.<br>
        No words.<br>
        No smile.<br>
        Nothing.<br>
        She tilted her head slightly, curious.<br>
        “Thank you, Nichole,” she said.<br>
        Her voice was music.<br>
        She knew my name.<br>
        She knew my name.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I walked away before my legs gave up.<br>
        But inside me, something cracked.<br>
        Not in a bad way…<br>
        But in the way a closed door finally opens a little—just enough for light to pass through.<br>
        That night, I stood outside, looking at the stars.<br>
        I remembered the quote that lived in my heart:<br>
        "Stars can’t shine without darkness."<br>
        She was the star.<br>
        I was the darkness.<br>
        And maybe… just maybe… we were made to meet.<br>
        Not to complete each other.<br>
        But to remind the world that even opposites can create something beautiful.

        “The more I stayed quiet… the louder her presence became in my soul.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        School became something else after that week.<br>
        It wasn’t just books and bells anymore.<br>
        It was her.<br>
        Hi Li.<br>
        Her name danced in my chest every time I walked into class.<br>
        Even when she wasn’t there yet, I’d feel her like a breeze before the rain.<br>
        She wasn’t the loud type.<br>
        She didn’t laugh like the popular girls, or gossip in corners like the others.<br>
        But whenever she passed by… people looked.<br>
        Not just because she was beautiful—no.<br>
        It was because she was different.<br>
        Like a quiet song playing in a room full of noise.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        One Monday morning, something unexpected happened.<br>
        Hi Li walked into class late.<br>
        And instead of taking her usual seat near the front with her uptown crew…<br>
        She sat two chairs away from me.<br>
        The room fell into a silent tension.<br>
        People looked. I looked down.<br>
        I could feel every breath she took.<br>
        Every shift of her hand.<br>
        The scent of something soft—jasmine and early rain—wrapped around my senses.<br>
        I couldn’t breathe properly.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Then came the moment that changed everything.<br>
        Mr. Lubega, our English teacher, walked in with his usual energy.<br>
        But this time, he wanted something else.<br>
        “Today,” he said, “we’re doing something different.<br>
        Pair work. Boy and girl. Front row with back row. No excuses.”<br>
        My heart stopped.<br>
        Hi Li was on my row.<br>
        I was at the back.<br>
        She turned her head slowly and looked at me.<br>
        Again. Those eyes.<br>
        She didn’t speak.<br>
        Just waited.<br>
        Mr. Lubega pointed.<br>
        “You two. Nichole and Hi Li. Work together.”
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I don’t remember how I stood.<br>
        I don’t remember walking to the desk we shared.<br>
        All I know is: for the first time…<br>
        I sat beside her.<br>
        Close enough to hear her heart if the room went quiet.<br>
        Close enough to smell her perfume on the page we shared.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        We were supposed to write a two-paragraph essay titled:<br>
        “What is Love?”<br>
        Bro… how was I supposed to write about love,<br>
        when it was literally sitting inches away from me?<br>
        She looked at the paper. Then at me.<br>
        Then she asked, “Should we start with your idea or mine?”<br>
        Her voice was calm. Almost playful.<br>
        I froze.<br>
        Then said, “You go first.”<br>
        She smiled.<br>
        It wasn’t big—but it held something warm.<br>
        She picked up the pen and wrote:<br>
        “Love is not about who has more.<br>
        Love is about who feels deeper.<br>
        It’s not about matching clothes, but matching hearts.”<br>
        She slid the paper toward me.<br>
        And said, “Now your turn.”
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        My hands trembled as I wrote beneath her words:<br>
        “Love is the language two hearts speak quietly when the world is too loud.<br>
        It’s not loud, it’s not proud… it’s a whisper that never dies.”<br>
        We both looked at each other.<br>
        Silence.<br>
        The kind that doesn’t need to be broken.<br>
        The kind that says more than words ever could.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        But then…<br>
        One of her friends—tall, loud, and sharp-tongued—walked in.<br>
        She saw us.<br>
        Saw the paper.<br>
        Saw the closeness.<br>
        And her face dropped.<br>
        She said loudly, “Hi Li? Really? You’re pairing with him now?”<br>
        The whole class turned.<br>
        I saw Hi Li glance down, then back at me.<br>
        And then… she smiled.<br>
        Not to them.<br>
        To me.<br>
        And said the words that made me feel like maybe… just maybe… I mattered:<br>
        “Yes. I chose this seat.”

    “I wanted to fix systems. She wanted to heal hearts. We both just wanted to make the world better.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    It was one of those rare days when the power went off during ICT class.<br>
    The teacher sighed and told us to just sit quietly until it returned. But for me, that was the perfect moment.<br>
    While others sat chatting, I reached into my backpack and pulled out the circuit board I had been secretly working on—a small project using pieces from old radios and phone chargers. Most people wouldn’t understand what it was. But to me? It was magic.<br>
    I was always that kid who wanted to know what lived behind the screen.<br>
    What made the light blink?<br>
    What made the machine think?<br>
    What made the app speak?<br>
    While others played games, I watched loading bars and opened settings—curious about every part of how it worked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across the room, Hi Li was writing in her pink nursing journal. I had seen her carrying it before. She told me once, “One day I want to touch lives—not with money, but with healing.”<br>
    I remember thinking, How do you fall in love with someone’s dream?<br>
    Because I think I did… that day.<br>
    She looked at me and smiled.<br>
    “What’s that thing you’re building?” she asked, pointing to my tiny setup.<br>
    “It’s… like a small brain,” I said, embarrassed. “It doesn’t think yet. But I want it to.”<br>
    “You’re trying to build a brain?” she giggled. “I’m trying to study one.”<br>
    We both laughed. Two different dreams, same heartbeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    We spent that whole free hour talking.<br>
    She told me how she watched her aunt—who’s a nurse—clean wounds and speak to patients with words that felt like medicine.<br>
    She said healing wasn’t just about injections and bandages.<br>
    It was about being there when no one else stays.<br>
    I told her how I once fixed an old phone just by watching YouTube videos with no sound.<br>
    How I wanted to build something that could help kids learn even when they have no teacher.<br>
    How code felt like poetry to me—just invisible and powerful.<br>
    She listened.<br>
    Not like someone being polite.<br>
    But like someone who really wanted to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the power came back on, everyone groaned.<br>
    But Hi Li and I looked at each other like, we didn’t need light to see each other now.
  </p>
  <p>
    Later that day, during lunch, I overheard one of her friends whisper,<br>
    “Why do you talk to that tech boy? He's not even our level.”<br>
    Hi Li just looked at her and said,<br>
    “Maybe because I like real conversations… not expensive silence.”<br>
    Bro. I swear I almost dropped my chapati.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I opened my notebook and started designing an app idea:<br>
    📱 HiCare — an offline health tips app for rural communities, inspired by Hi Li’s passion.<br>
    I didn’t tell her yet.<br>
    But it felt right.<br>
    Like maybe our dreams weren’t so different after all.

    “I wanted to believe I had a chance. But sometimes, love feels illegal in the world you come from.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    After that talk in ICT class, things changed between me and Hi Li.<br>
    Not loudly. Not publicly.<br>
    But quietly… like a secret rhythm only the two of us could hear.<br>
    Every time I walked into class, her eyes would meet mine.<br>
    A soft smile. A quiet nod.<br>
    And suddenly, the day felt lighter.<br>
    We’d talk during breaks—nothing too obvious.<br>
    Just short walks, shared laughter, exchanged dreams.<br>
    But every word felt like we were writing a story the world wasn’t ready for.
  </p>
  <p>
    But not everyone smiled with us.<br>
    The uptown crowd had started watching.<br>
    Whispers began.<br>
    “She’s wasting time with that tech guy.”<br>
    “Does she know his shoes aren’t even new?”<br>
    “Maybe she’s just curious. It won’t last.”<br>
    One time, I passed near the school canteen and heard one of her friends laugh:<br>
    “It’s cute she’s playing community service with him. Poor guy probably thinks it’s real.”<br>
    That one hit hard.<br>
    Because the truth is…<br>
    I did think it was real.
  </p>
  <p>
    I stopped talking to her for two days.<br>
    Not because I didn’t care.<br>
    But because I cared too much.<br>
    And I was scared.<br>
    Scared that I wasn’t enough.<br>
    That I’d never be enough.<br>
    We came from two different planets.<br>
    She had a driver. I walked.<br>
    She had clean shoes. Mine had dust.<br>
    She talked about med school. I talked about building an app.<br>
    It felt like trying to hold the stars with bare hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    But on the third day, she found me behind the lab block, where I usually went to hide when the world got too loud.<br>
    She sat beside me without asking.<br>
    “You’re avoiding me,” she said.<br>
    I didn’t speak.<br>
    She looked at me, softly.<br>
    “Nichole,” she whispered, “I know they talk. I hear them too.”<br>
    I looked away.<br>
    “It’s not that, Hi Li. I just… don’t want to pull you down.”<br>
    She laughed. Not at me. But gently.<br>
    “You think you’re darkness, and I’m light,” she said.<br>
    “But Nichole, stars only shine because of darkness. Without your world, mine wouldn’t even sparkle.”<br>
    I turned to her, heart beating like a drum.<br>
    “I just don’t want to ruin what you have.”<br>
    And she said something I’ll never forget:<br>
    “What I have isn’t what I want. But what I feel with you? That’s real.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro… I almost cried.<br>
    Right there in the shade, beside the back wall of our little broken school block…<br>
    She held my hand.<br>
    Not tight.<br>
    Just enough to say, I’m here.<br>
    I see you.<br>
    I choose this.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the first time… I didn’t feel like a boy from nowhere.<br>
    I felt like someone who belonged in someone’s world.<br>
    In her world.<br>
    And suddenly, I didn’t care about what they said.<br>
    Because even if I was darkness…<br>
    She was the star that wanted to stay.

    “Sometimes, love speaks louder through purpose than poetry.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    After that talk behind the lab block, something in me shifted.<br>
    I stopped hiding.<br>
    I didn’t care who was watching anymore when we talked.<br>
    Didn’t care if her friends rolled their eyes.<br>
    Didn’t care if people whispered.<br>
    All I knew was this: Hi Li saw me.<br>
    Not just my face. Not my dusty shoes.<br>
    She saw the boy who wanted to build the future… with his own two hands.<br>
    And now, I was ready to take the next step.
  </p>
  <p>
    It started with a simple idea: HiCare.<br>
    The app that could share basic first aid and health tips offline, in local languages.<br>
    I had already started designing it in my notebook—its colors, the layout, and the sections.<br>
    But I needed her voice in it. Her heart.<br>
    “Hi Li,” I told her one afternoon, “I want to build something with you.”<br>
    She looked up from her nursing journal.<br>
    “Together?” she asked.<br>
    “Yes,” I said. “You know the healing. I know the code. Why not make something that helps the people we care about?”<br>
    Her eyes sparkled.<br>
    “Nichole… that’s the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever asked me to build.”
  </p>
  <p>
    So we started.<br>
    After classes, we’d meet at the back of the computer lab—just her, me, a scratched laptop, and dreams larger than our town.<br>
    She would explain simple health concepts:<br>
    What to do when someone faints.<br>
    How to treat a burn.<br>
    Signs of dehydration.<br>
    How to help someone during a panic attack.<br>
    And I would turn her words into screens and buttons—designing the app bit by bit.
  </p>
  <p>
    But of course… the world noticed.<br>
    One evening, as we were walking out of the lab, we heard it:<br>
    “He’s using her. Just wants to climb out of poverty with her name.”<br>
    Another voice chimed in:<br>
    “She doesn’t even realize he’s beneath her.”<br>
    Hi Li froze.<br>
    I expected her to stay quiet.<br>
    But she turned—sharp and clear.<br>
    “You think I’m helping him?<br>
    What if he’s helping me?<br>
    What if love isn’t about who has more… but who brings out your best?”<br>
    The silence that followed was louder than thunder.<br>
    She didn’t wait for them to respond.<br>
    She just grabbed my hand, and we walked away.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro… I’ll never forget that walk.<br>
    It felt like I wasn’t just loved—I was fought for.<br>
    And you know what’s rare?<br>
    A love that doesn’t just whisper in the dark,<br>
    but shouts in the daylight.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I added one last section to the app mockup:<br>
    🫶 Mental Health: How to feel safe when your heart is tired.<br>
    Because even if we were trying to heal others—<br>
    We were also healing each other.

    It all began with a note.<br>
    A small, folded piece of paper slipped under my math book.<br>
    I opened it casually during class, expecting a joke or some anonymous encouragement like before.<br>
    But what I read stopped me cold:<br>
    “Uptown girls don’t stay with boys like you.<br>
    Walk away before she gets hurt.”<br>
    There was no name.<br>
    Just pain.<br>
    And suddenly, every second of peace I had built with Hi Li began to crack.
  </p>
  <p>
    That evening, I tried to act normal when we met in the computer lab to work on HiCare.<br>
    But something had changed in me.<br>
    I was quiet.<br>
    Distracted.<br>
    Cold.<br>
    She noticed.<br>
    “You’re not here,” she said, placing her hand gently over mine. “Where did you go?”<br>
    I looked at her, and for a second… I wanted to tell her everything.<br>
    But the fear came rushing back.<br>
    Not fear of her—but fear of losing her.<br>
    Fear that maybe, just maybe, the note was right.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next few days were strange.<br>
    Hi Li didn’t stop showing up.<br>
    She still smiled, still shared ideas, still believed in us.<br>
    But I was pulling away.<br>
    It’s funny how you can love someone deeply, and still think you're protecting them by pushing them out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then came Friday.<br>
    The school cultural event.<br>
    Everyone was there—students in colorful outfits, music blasting, food being shared.<br>
    But I wasn’t in the mood for joy.<br>
    I sat near the far end of the compound, alone, watching shadows stretch across the grass.<br>
    And that’s when I saw her.<br>
    Hi Li, in a white and blue floral dress, standing beside someone I didn’t recognize at first.<br>
    Tall. Clean shoes. iPhone in hand.<br>
    Gold watch flashing in the sun.<br>
    And then he laughed.<br>
    Touched her arm.<br>
    She didn’t pull away.<br>
    My chest tightened.
  </p>
  <p>
    Later that day, I found out:<br>
    He was her cousin. From abroad.<br>
    Uptown to the bone.<br>
    And apparently, he was staying with her family for the holiday.<br>
    But rumors don’t wait for truth.<br>
    By the next morning, whispers spread:<br>
    “She’s getting matched.”<br>
    “Her parents prefer someone else.”<br>
    “She was just playing school love.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro… I won’t lie.<br>
    I was broken.<br>
    I stopped answering her texts.<br>
    Stopped coming to the lab.<br>
    Stopped believing in HiCare—in us.
  </p>
  <p>
    On Monday, she came looking for me.<br>
    “Nichole,” she said, finding me behind the canteen. “Why are you shutting me out?”<br>
    I looked at her, not with anger… but with the kind of sadness that builds in silence.<br>
    “I saw you,” I whispered.<br>
    “With my cousin?” she asked, confused.<br>
    I nodded.<br>
    She stepped closer.<br>
    “You think I would just move on like that?” she said, her voice trembling. “After everything we’ve built?”<br>
    I stayed quiet.<br>
    Then she pulled something out of her bag—a folded note.<br>
    The same note that had been left for me.<br>
    “I found this in my locker,” she said. “It’s not just you they’re warning… it’s me too.”<br>
    She looked me dead in the eyes.<br>
    “They don’t want us together.<br>
    But I’m not walking away.<br>
    Not unless you do.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro… I broke.<br>
    Tears I had swallowed for days started falling.<br>
    Not because I was weak.<br>
    But because I realized…<br>
    She was choosing me. Even in the storm.<br>
    And this time… I wasn’t going to run.

    “They judged me by where I came from… until they saw what I could build with my own hands.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    After that moment behind the canteen—when Hi Li showed me the note and chose us—something inside me changed forever.<br>
    I wasn’t scared anymore.<br>
    Not of her parents. Not of the whispers.<br>
    Not even of being heartbroken.<br>
    Because I had already lost myself once.<br>
    Now, I had something worth standing for.
  </p>
  <p>
    That week, I locked myself in the computer lab after school every day.<br>
    I coded late.<br>
    Tested features.<br>
    Debugged the glitches in HiCare.<br>
    Even when the power went off, I used the light from my small solar lamp to keep going.<br>
    Hi Li brought me snacks. Water. Encouragement.<br>
    And her notebook—full of notes on health tips, emergency procedures, and mental wellness.<br>
    We worked like a team.<br>
    No, like a vision in motion.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day, we got a chance.<br>
    Our school announced a Tech & Innovation Day.<br>
    A chance for students to showcase their projects to parents, alumni, and local leaders.<br>
    I wasn’t going to sign up at first.<br>
    But Hi Li looked me straight in the eye and said:<br>
    “Nichole… if they won’t listen to your story, make them listen to your work.”<br>
    So we did it.<br>
    We signed up. As one team.<br>
    Nichole and Hi Li.<br>
    Code and Care.
  </p>
  <p>
    The day came fast.<br>
    I wore my best shirt. The one Mama had ironed gently that morning.<br>
    Hi Li wore a simple white blouse with a red ribbon in her hair.<br>
    We weren’t flashy.<br>
    But we were real.<br>
    Our project booth was small. Just a poster and one borrowed laptop.<br>
    But on that screen lived the soul of our struggle:<br>
    HiCare — Health in Your Hands<br>
    📱 Offline app<br>
    🫶 Health tips in local language<br>
    💊 First aid, mental health, maternal care<br>
    🔋 No internet required
  </p>
  <p>
    People passed by at first, uninterested.<br>
    Until one old man stopped.<br>
    Read the title.<br>
    Clicked through the screens.<br>
    He called his friend.<br>
    Then a teacher joined.<br>
    Then a nurse.<br>
    Then a journalist from a local paper.<br>
    Within minutes, our small booth was surrounded.<br>
    Hi Li explained the health side.<br>
    I explained the tech side.<br>
    And bro, the moment that hit me hardest… was when I looked up and saw her father standing at the back.<br>
    Sunglasses in shirt pocket.<br>
    Arms crossed.<br>
    Watching.
  </p>
  <p>
    He didn’t say anything.<br>
    Just watched.<br>
    Then turned and walked away.<br>
    But I saw something in his eyes.<br>
    Not approval.<br>
    Not anger.<br>
    Something else: respect.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, Hi Li messaged me:<br>
    “He didn’t say a word. But for the first time… he didn’t stop me from texting you.”<br>
    And then:<br>
    “We’re making them see it, Nichole.<br>
    Not by shouting… but by showing.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro… that was the night I knew.<br>
    This wasn’t just love.<br>
    It was a mission.<br>
    To prove that dreams don’t come from class.<br>
    They come from courage.<br>
    And ours?<br>
    Was just beginning.

    "Some people hate what they don’t understand. And some try to destroy what they secretly admire."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Three days after Tech & Innovation Day, I got called to the principal’s office.<br>
    I had done nothing wrong—at least, I thought I hadn’t.<br>
    But the look on his face told me this wasn’t just a “check-in.”<br>
    “Nichole,” he began, “We’ve received reports that your project HiCare may have used code copied from an existing app.”<br>
    I froze.<br>
    “What?” I whispered.<br>
    “It’s a serious claim,” he continued. “We have to investigate. You’re suspended from the competition for now.”<br>
    My heart dropped into my shoes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I left the office like a ghost.<br>
    The sky was too quiet. The air too sharp.<br>
    Hi Li came running when she heard.<br>
    “What happened?” she asked, breathless.<br>
    I told her everything.<br>
    The accusation. The suspension. The shame.<br>
    She looked stunned—then angry.<br>
    “Who would do that?” she whispered.<br>
    I already knew the answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    It didn’t take long for the truth to slip out.<br>
    Her cousin.<br>
    The one with the iPhone and the golden watch.<br>
    The one who had smiled too politely.<br>
    He had a connection with the PTA head and had “shared concerns” about HiCare being “too advanced” for a student like me.<br>
    He was trying to protect her “image.”<br>
    Trying to clean the uptown name from downtown dust.<br>
    Hi Li was furious.<br>
    She stormed into her father’s office that evening and defended me.<br>
    She showed him my handwritten diagrams, the GitHub page I had opened weeks ago, and the months we had spent building.<br>
    But the damage was done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rumors spread fast.<br>
    “Nichole’s a fraud.”<br>
    “He stole the app.”<br>
    “He was using her to climb.”<br>
    Even some of the teachers who once praised me started whispering doubts behind my back.<br>
    I stayed home the next day.<br>
    Didn’t go online.<br>
    Didn’t touch my code.<br>
    Didn’t reply to Hi Li’s messages.
  </p>
  <p>
    But then…<br>
    She showed up at my doorstep.<br>
    She didn’t care about the mud, or the noise, or the boda-bodas flying past.<br>
    She came with a backpack and a folded paper in her hand.<br>
    When I opened the door, she looked at me with wet eyes and said:<br>
    “You don’t get to disappear. Not when we’re this close.”<br>
    She opened the paper.<br>
    It was a letter of invitation.<br>
    HiCare has been selected to pitch at the National Student Innovation Summit in Kampala.<br>
    Two representatives allowed.<br>
    Travel and accommodation covered.<br>
    I stared at it, heart pounding.<br>
    “I’m going with you,” she said.<br>
    “Whether they believe in you or not… I do.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro, I won’t lie.<br>
    That moment broke every fear I had left inside me.<br>
    Not because she saved me.<br>
    But because she reminded me:<br>
    Love doesn’t need to be believed by everyone—only lived by the ones who feel it.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I opened my laptop.<br>
    Typed the words:<br>
    Welcome to HiCare.<br>
    Made with love, built with purpose.<br>
    And I hit save.<br>
    Because the dream wasn’t over.<br>
    It was just beginning.

    “The stars didn’t just shine… they chose to shine for me.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    We were supposed to stay low.<br>
    After the note.<br>
    After the silence.<br>
    After the rumors.<br>
    But Hi Li didn’t believe in shrinking for anyone.<br>
    Not even for the world that once shaped her like a porcelain doll.<br>
    And that’s when everything changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The school held a Talent Night—just for fun.<br>
    No competition, no awards, just expression.<br>
    The usual names were on the list:<br>
    Rogers doing his rap. Sophie singing a Rema cover.<br>
    The Uptown girls doing their TikTok-inspired dance.<br>
    I hadn’t even planned to go.<br>
    I didn’t want to sit in a room filled with people who weren’t sure if I belonged.<br>
    But as I stepped out of the gate with my hoodie on, someone caught my wrist.<br>
    It was Hi Li.<br>
    “Come,” she said, smiling.<br>
    “I’m not really in the mood,” I replied.<br>
    She looked at me with those fearless eyes.<br>
    “But I am. And tonight… you need to see me.”
  </p>
  <p>
    I sat at the back of the crowd, alone.<br>
    The stage was nothing more than a few lights and a mic.<br>
    But in my chest, it felt like the whole world was watching.<br>
    Then the emcee announced:<br>
    “Next up — Hi Li, performing something original…”<br>
    I froze.<br>
    Original?<br>
    Hi Li? Performing?<br>
    She walked onstage in a plain black dress.<br>
    Hair tied back. No jewelry. No fancy shoes.<br>
    Just presence.
  </p>
  <p>
    And then… she didn’t sing.<br>
    She didn’t dance.<br>
    She spoke.<br>
    A poem.<br>
    A fire wrapped in velvet.<br>
    “They say a girl like me should only walk with heels…<br>
    But I walk better in truth.”<br>
    “They say love should be clean, quiet, proper…<br>
    But mine has wire dust, code bugs, and a boy who dreams through broken power banks.”<br>
    “He didn’t bring me flowers.<br>
    He brought me courage.<br>
    And I chose him.”
  </p>
  <p>
    My hands trembled.<br>
    She wasn’t hiding it.<br>
    She wasn’t whispering it behind closed doors.<br>
    She was saying it out loud.<br>
    In front of them.<br>
    In front of everyone.<br>
    “Stars aren’t just born to be watched…<br>
    Sometimes, they choose the darkness —<br>
    Because that’s the only place they can truly shine.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The crowd sat in silence.<br>
    No laughter. No gossip. Just awe.<br>
    Then came the claps.<br>
    Not forced.<br>
    Not polite.<br>
    Real.<br>
    Even the ones who had doubted her.<br>
    Even the friends who once warned her.<br>
    Even the teachers who had rolled their eyes at me.<br>
    That night, she didn’t just shine.<br>
    She burned through the noise.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the show, I didn’t even move.<br>
    She found me at the back.<br>
    I looked up at her. “Why?” I asked.<br>
    She smiled.<br>
    “Because I was tired of hiding stars that were meant to be seen.”<br>
    “And tonight, I wasn’t just the Uptown girl.”<br>
    “I was your girl.”
  </p>
  <p>
    And that night, I realized:<br>
    Some people hide love in private…<br>
    But she lit it like a lamp in front of a crowd.<br>
    Not for fame.<br>
    Not for attention.<br>
    But because real love doesn’t whisper when the world’s too loud — it speaks louder.

    “Sometimes, success opens doors… but it also opens eyes.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    We arrived in Kampala on a Wednesday afternoon.<br>
    The city moved fast — boda-bodas zigzagging through traffic, billboards flashing with ads, people in suits and students with headphones.<br>
    I’d never seen so many buildings that touched the sky.<br>
    Hi Li and I stepped out of the taxi, wide-eyed, holding the future in a flash drive — our dream: HiCare.<br>
    We were finalists at the National Student Innovation Summit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hotel looked like it belonged in a movie.<br>
    Automatic glass doors. Floors that smelled like lavender. Staff who called me “sir.”<br>
    I wasn’t used to it.<br>
    But Hi Li?<br>
    She fit in like she had always lived there.<br>
    Polished. Calm. Confident.<br>
    “Let’s register,” she whispered with a wink.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first evening was a welcome dinner.<br>
    That’s where it began.<br>
    We were seated with students from international schools — polished accents, MacBooks on their laps, talking about AI and machine learning like it was air.<br>
    One guy in glasses leaned across the table and asked:<br>
    “You two are from Central Uganda Secondary? Never heard of it. Where is that?”<br>
    I tried to explain.<br>
    Before I finished, he cut in:<br>
    “Ohhh, cool. Rural vibes. You built HiCare, right? Heard it’s surprisingly decent.”<br>
    Surprisingly.<br>
    That word stabbed more than he knew.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next morning was rehearsal day.<br>
    Each team had ten minutes to pitch.<br>
    Most came with team shirts, glossy slides, fancy transitions.<br>
    I had a basic PowerPoint and my heart in my hands.<br>
    When our name was called, we stepped up.<br>
    I introduced HiCare.<br>
    Spoke of the challenges in rural health.<br>
    The offline mode.<br>
    The multilingual support.<br>
    Hi Li took the mic next:<br>
    “It’s not just an app. It’s a nurse in your pocket.<br>
    Built not for the rich, but for the forgotten.”
  </p>
  <p>
    We nailed it.<br>
    Even the judges smiled.<br>
    But later in the hallway, I overheard it.<br>
    “He’s probably just her assistant or something.”<br>
    “Do you think she really likes him or it’s a charity case?”<br>
    “A nurse and a coder? That’s not a real match.”<br>
    I stood still, staring at the floor tiles.<br>
    I had finally made it to the stage…<br>
    But I still felt like a shadow in someone else’s light.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I couldn’t sleep.<br>
    I stepped out onto the hotel balcony.<br>
    The city lights blinked like stars.<br>
    But they felt distant.<br>
    Cold.<br>
    Hi Li joined me with two cups of warm juice.<br>
    She sat quietly.<br>
    Then asked:<br>
    “Do you feel like you don’t belong here?”<br>
    I didn’t answer. But she already knew.<br>
    She leaned her head on my shoulder and whispered:<br>
    “You don’t belong here, Nichole.<br>
    You belong beyond here.”<br>
    “They don’t see it yet.<br>
    But I do.<br>
    And that’s enough.”
  </p>
  <p>
    And that’s when I realized:<br>
    Belonging isn’t about the room you're in.<br>
    It’s about the person who believes you deserve to be there.<br>
    And I had that person beside me.

    “Not every storm comes to destroy you. Some come to reveal who’s truly holding your hand.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    After the pitch in Kampala, we made headlines.<br>
    Small ones at first. Local blogs. School forums.<br>
    Then came a call from a youth innovation podcast. Then an email from a tech hub asking if we’d like to incubate HiCare after our exams.<br>
    It felt unreal.<br>
    But the higher we climbed…<br>
    …the more the winds tried to knock us down.
  </p>
  <p>
    It started with whispers at school.<br>
    “She’s just doing it for attention.”<br>
    “He’s using her to escape his background.”<br>
    “They’ll break up after the project wins something.”<br>
    Even our classmates divided into sides.<br>
    Some jealous of Hi Li’s spotlight.<br>
    Others waiting for me to fail.<br>
    I tried to ignore it.<br>
    Tried to focus on coding, on school, on breathing.<br>
    But then…<br>
    One morning, I opened my laptop to check our shared cloud folder.<br>
    And it was gone.<br>
    All of it.<br>
    HiCare's backend. The updated UI. The notes. The timeline.<br>
    Deleted.
  </p>
  <p>
    I stared at the empty screen, my breath locked in my throat.<br>
    I called Hi Li.<br>
    She ran across the school field in slippers to meet me in the computer lab.<br>
    We checked everything.<br>
    The trash folder. The backups. The logs.<br>
    Someone had accessed it.<br>
    Someone who had our link and password.<br>
    My head spun.<br>
    “I only shared it with you,” I said softly.<br>
    “And I only ever opened it on my laptop,” she replied.<br>
    But someone else had gotten in.
  </p>
  <p>
    The principal launched an investigation.<br>
    And that’s when we learned…<br>
    It was Sophie.<br>
    Her friend. Her roommate.<br>
    The one who had “supported” our relationship publicly… but rolled her eyes privately.<br>
    She had taken the password from Hi Li’s open notebook while she was in the shower.<br>
    Why?<br>
    “I was tired of watching her ruin herself for a guy who will never fit in her world.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Hi Li was devastated.<br>
    She didn’t cry.<br>
    She didn’t scream.<br>
    She just stood silently outside the headteacher’s office while Sophie was suspended.<br>
    Then she turned to me and said:<br>
    “They think this breaks us?”<br>
    “They forgot we built this with nothing. We can build it again.”
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, we stayed in the library until midnight.<br>
    Rebuilding.<br>
    Slide by slide. Line by line. Page by page.<br>
    We didn’t speak much.<br>
    But in the silence… there was strength.<br>
    Real love isn’t loud all the time.<br>
    Sometimes it’s just two people choosing each other again after the world tries to tear them apart.

    “Some people smile so brightly… just to hide how much they’ve been surviving.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    We had rebuilt HiCare.<br>
    We had been featured in a youth tech magazine.<br>
    We had survived sabotage, doubt, and public humiliation.<br>
    And yet…<br>
    She still cried sometimes.<br>
    Not loudly. Not dramatically.<br>
    Just those quiet tears when no one was looking.<br>
    When the world thought she was okay… but I knew better.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was a Friday evening.<br>
    We were sitting on the edge of the football field, watching the sky change from gold to grey.<br>
    Her head was resting on my shoulder, but I could feel her shaking a little.<br>
    “You okay?” I asked softly.<br>
    She didn’t answer.<br>
    She just whispered:<br>
    “Do you ever feel like you have to be perfect… because if you make one mistake, the whole world will say, ‘I told you so’?”
  </p>
  <p>
    I stayed silent.<br>
    Because I knew that feeling.<br>
    But I also knew… this wasn’t about me.<br>
    This was her opening the door to something deeper.<br>
    And then she said it:<br>
    “When I was ten, my mom left.”<br>
    The words felt like thunder in the calm.<br>
    “She said she needed to ‘find herself.’<br>
    But she never looked back to find me.”
  </p>
  <p>
    I turned to her, unsure if I should speak.<br>
    But she kept going.<br>
    “Everyone thinks I’m this confident, smart uptown girl…<br>
    But inside, I still feel like the child who wasn’t enough for her mother to stay.”<br>
    “I didn’t start nursing because I loved needles.<br>
    I started because I promised myself I’d never leave anyone broken and bleeding like I was.”
  </p>
  <p>
    My heart broke quietly beside her.<br>
    I didn’t have the perfect thing to say.<br>
    No quote or code or poetic line.<br>
    So I just reached for her hand.<br>
    And she held on like she had been drowning for years…<br>
    and finally found something solid.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I walked home slower than usual.<br>
    Thinking about her tears.<br>
    About the strength she shows the world, and the cracks she hides behind that smile.<br>
    And I realized:<br>
    I wasn’t in love with the perfect girl from uptown.<br>
    I was in love with the real her — broken, brave, beautiful.<br>
    And maybe…<br>
    She was falling for the real me too.

    “Some people vanish without slamming the door… and that silence is louder than a thousand goodbyes.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    It started like any other Monday.<br>
    But she didn’t show up to class.<br>
    No text. No call. No “running late” emoji.<br>
    Just… silence.
  </p>
  <p>
    I waited.<br>
    Lunch passed. Still nothing.<br>
    Then the whispers started.<br>
    “She’s gone.”<br>
    “Transferred.”<br>
    “Her father pulled her out last night.”<br>
    I couldn’t believe it.<br>
    Not Hi Li.<br>
    Not after everything we fought through.<br>
    Not after the summit. The long nights. The stolen smiles.
  </p>
  <p>
    I ran to the nurse’s station.<br>
    Empty.<br>
    I checked her favorite window spot in the library.<br>
    Only dust.<br>
    Her locker? Cleared out.<br>
    Not even a sticky note left behind.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I sat by my laptop —<br>
    HiCare open, her voice still saved in the intro screen:<br>
    “Helping hearts, one care at a time.”<br>
    I played it again and again.<br>
    Just to feel like she was still near.
  </p>
  <p>
    Three days passed.<br>
    No sign.<br>
    No word.<br>
    No Hi Li.<br>
    Even her socials went quiet.<br>
    It was like she had vanished into air.<br>
    No chance to ask why.<br>
    No chance to say don’t go.<br>
    No chance to say I love you… and I always did.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the fourth day, a letter came.<br>
    No name. No return address.<br>
    Just my name.<br>
    Written in her handwriting.<br>
    I opened it with shaking hands.<br>
    Inside, one line:<br>
    “I didn’t want to leave. But sometimes love means staying silent… when speaking would hurt more.”<br>
    And folded with it —<br>
    a photo of us in front of the Summit banner.<br>
    My arm around her.<br>
    Her eyes smiling through tears.
  </p>
  <p>
    I stared at it until my vision blurred.<br>
    Because that’s the thing about real love:<br>
    It doesn’t always end with a kiss.<br>
    Sometimes, it ends with an empty seat beside you… and a heart still full.

    “Some pain doesn't break you… it becomes the reason you rise.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The days after she left felt endless.<br>
    No goodbye.<br>
    No warning.<br>
    Just silence… again.<br>
    But this time, it wasn’t the soft silence we used to share under trees.<br>
    This silence burned.<br>
    This silence was war.
  </p>
  <p>
    People said I should’ve known better.<br>
    “She was never yours to keep.”<br>
    “Uptown girls don’t marry downtown dreams.”<br>
    “Move on, Nichole. Be realistic.”<br>
    But how do you move on from someone who made you feel seen?<br>
    How do you unlearn a love that felt like purpose?
  </p>
  <p>
    I stopped coding for a while.<br>
    I couldn’t stare at the screen without seeing her face in the loading bar.<br>
    Couldn’t hear the soft keyboard taps without hearing her laugh.<br>
    Even the sun seemed tired of shining.
  </p>
  <p>
    But then one night…<br>
    I found the notebook.<br>
    The black one — covered in tech stickers and quiet memories.<br>
    Inside were pages we had filled together:<br>
    How to make care easier.<br>
    How to connect nurses to patients.<br>
    How love can power design.<br>
    I ran my fingers across the page where she had written:<br>
    “Dream big. We’re not just making an app… we’re making a bridge.”
  </p>
  <p>
    And something snapped awake in me.<br>
    A kind of holy rage.<br>
    Not angry at her.<br>
    Not angry at the world.<br>
    But angry at the idea that this is where it ends.<br>
    No.<br>
    This wasn’t the end.<br>
    It was the breaking before the becoming.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I got up.<br>
    Opened my laptop.<br>
    Lit a candle — not for light, but for focus.<br>
    And I began again.<br>
    Line by line.<br>
    Bug by bug.<br>
    Pain by pain.<br>
    HiCare Version 3.0 was born not out of joy…<br>
    …but out of the ashes of love.
  </p>
  <p>
    Weeks passed.<br>
    The app got cleaner.<br>
    Smarter.<br>
    Stronger.<br>
    So did I.<br>
    I started walking taller in hallways again.<br>
    Not because the whispers stopped.<br>
    But because they no longer mattered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Grayson (Big Bro GPT) messaged me one day:<br>
    “Still standing?”<br>
    I replied:<br>
    “Still rising.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro, that pain changed me.<br>
    It didn’t take away the love.<br>
    It refined it.<br>
    Turned it into fuel.<br>
    Turned it into fire.<br>
    Turned me into something I didn’t know I could be:<br>
    A boy who once loved a girl…<br>
    and now builds to honor her memory.

  <p>
    It was a rainy Saturday.<br>
    Clouds hung low like the weight in my chest.<br>
    I had just returned from school —<br>
    trying to pretend I was okay.<br>
    Trying to focus on finals. On rebuilding HiCare.<br>
    On anything… but her.<br>
    Then the mailman called my name.<br>
    “Nichole! Got something for you.”<br>
    An envelope.<br>
    No return address.<br>
    No stamp.<br>
    Just one word written in blue ink:<br>
    “Read.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Inside was the first letter.<br>
    Hi Li’s handwriting. The soft curve of her “L.”<br>
    The way she dotted her “i” like a tiny heart.<br>
    I held my breath as I began to read.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Nichole…<br>
    I wanted to write this before I left, but I didn’t have the courage.<br>
    So I wrote it after I was gone.<br>
    I hated leaving. I cried the whole night.<br>
    But my dad said it was for my ‘future.’<br>
    He didn’t want me caught in a ‘downtown scandal.’<br>
    But love isn’t a scandal.<br>
    It’s how you helped me believe in my dreams.<br>
    How you looked at me like I wasn’t just the Uptown Girl…<br>
    but a girl who mattered, who could heal, who could care.<br>
    I miss your quiet.<br>
    I miss your mind.<br>
    I miss us.<br>
    Please don’t stop building.<br>
    Build what we dreamed.<br>
    Make HiCare the light it was meant to be.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I paused.<br>
    My heart ached in places I didn’t know were still alive.<br>
    Then I noticed something at the bottom:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Turn over.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I flipped the page.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “P.S. I left something behind.”<br>
    “Check the back of your physics textbook.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I rushed to my bookshelf —<br>
    Pulled out the old, worn physics book we used to share during study sessions.<br>
    There it was.<br>
    A folded sticky note, still smelling faintly of lavender:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “I never said goodbye…<br>
    because deep down, I knew we’d meet again.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I sat down, clutching the note like a lifeline.<br>
    Tears fell.<br>
    Not of pain…<br>
    but of love that refused to die.<br>
    And in that moment, I realized:<br>
    Sometimes, the people we lose aren’t really gone.<br>
    They live in the pages,<br>
    in the projects,<br>
    in the promises we keep.

    “Time didn’t forget us. It was preparing us.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    It was at the HealthTech Expo in Kampala.<br>
    I didn’t expect to see her there.<br>
    Not in that crowd of entrepreneurs, judges, cameras, and tech giants.<br>
    Not after everything.<br>
    But fate doesn’t ask for permission.<br>
    It just shows up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was standing by the HiCare booth.<br>
    Presentation board ready.<br>
    Screens polished.<br>
    Nervous energy bouncing in my chest like code in a loop.<br>
    Then I heard a voice.<br>
    Soft. Familiar.<br>
    Like a bookmark I thought I had lost.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “You made it.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I turned.<br>
    And there she was.<br>
    Hi Li.<br>
    Same eyes.<br>
    Same light.<br>
    But something had changed.<br>
    She was... stronger. Quieter. Deeper.<br>
    Like the silence we once shared had grown inside her too.
  </p>
  <p>
    “HiCare looks beautiful,” she said, tracing the logo with her eyes.<br>
    I didn’t know what to say.<br>
    Do I say I missed you?<br>
    Do I ask Why did you leave?<br>
    Do I pretend like my heart didn’t memorize the sound of her voice?
  </p>
  <p>
    “You left,” I finally said.<br>
    She nodded.<br>
    “I did.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Then silence — the old kind.<br>
    But this time, it didn’t hurt.<br>
    It healed.<br>
    Because this silence wasn’t absence.<br>
    It was understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    She reached into her bag and pulled out something.<br>
    A bracelet.<br>
    The same one I had given her — a white band with the words:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Built with Love, Coded with Care.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    “I wore it every day,” she whispered.<br>
    “Even when I didn’t know if I deserved it.”<br>
    My hands trembled.<br>
    “I thought you forgot me.”<br>
    She shook her head.<br>
    “I tried. But you’re the kind of memory that lives even in shadows.”
  </p>
  <p>
    We didn’t say sorry.<br>
    We didn’t say come back.<br>
    We just… stood there.<br>
    Two worlds.<br>
    Same orbit.<br>
    Finally aligned.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I’m studying nursing now,” she smiled.<br>
    My eyes lit up.<br>
    “And you?”<br>
    “I’m still building,” I said. “Apps. Purpose. Dreams.”<br>
    She looked proud.<br>
    Not just of HiCare.<br>
    Of me.<br>
    Of us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before she left, she handed me a folded note.<br>
    I waited till she was gone before opening it.<br>
    It read:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Some stars don’t disappear. They just learn how to shine in silence. I’m proud of you, Nichole. Always.”

  <p>
    Kampala felt different this time.<br>
    The traffic was still loud.<br>
    The city still wild with movement and dreams.<br>
    But inside me… everything had changed.<br>
    I wasn’t the same boy who hid in the back of classrooms.<br>
    Who doubted his worth.<br>
    Who needed permission to believe in his own vision.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the Expo, I was offered a scholarship to pursue tech innovation.<br>
    Not just to build apps — but to teach others how.<br>
    HiCare was no longer just a project.<br>
    It was a mission.
  </p>
  <p>
    And I was no longer “that downtown boy.”<br>
    I was Nichole.<br>
    A creator. A coder. A story written by fire, tested by silence, and refined by love.
  </p>
  <p>
    People started recognizing me.<br>
    Some who once ignored me now wanted to partner.<br>
    A girl who once laughed when I said “I build apps” now DM’d me asking for mentorship.<br>
    Funny how success changes perception.<br>
    But I didn’t let it change my heart.<br>
    Because pain had been my teacher.<br>
    Love had been my compass.<br>
    And silence… had been my voice.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day, I walked past the mirror and didn’t look away.<br>
    For the first time, I liked the reflection.<br>
    Not because it was perfect —<br>
    But because it was real.
  </p>
  <p>
    I remembered the boy who sat alone at lunch.<br>
    The one who scribbled code on napkins.<br>
    The one who was too shy to say “Hi” to Hi Li.<br>
    I smiled at him.<br>
    He had no idea he would become a light for others.
  </p>
  <p>
    The city didn’t get quieter.<br>
    The world didn’t get softer.<br>
    But I had become louder — not with noise, but with purpose.<br>
    And even when storms came again —<br>
    Because they always do —<br>
    I no longer feared them.<br>
    Because I had learned to shine in the dark.

    It wasn’t a wedding.<br>

    Me and Hi Li sitting on a rooftop.<br>
    Above us, the city was glowing.<br>
    Not just from buildings, but from possibility.<br>
    She held my hand.<br>
    Her nails still neat, her books still full of anatomy notes.<br>
    She was studying nursing now, full-time.<br>
    Still saving lives. Still soft. Still fire.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had launched HiCare officially —<br>
    Now used in five districts.<br>
    A small app. A huge change.<br>
    And that day on the rooftop, she whispered:<br>
    “You said stars needed darkness to shine.<br>
    But maybe… some stars are born from the darkness.”
  </p>
  <p>
    I looked at her and didn’t feel small anymore.<br>
    Didn’t feel like I didn’t belong.<br>
    Because I knew — belonging isn’t about where you start.<br>
    It’s about where you’re willing to go.<br>
    And who’s willing to go there with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    She was the Uptown Girl.<br>
    I was the Downtown Dreamer.<br>
    And in a world that told us we didn’t match...<br>
    We rewrote the code.<br>
    Not just in tech —<br>
    But in love.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Grayson?<br>
    Yeah, I didn’t forget him.<br>
    That quiet voice in my head.<br>
    That encourager behind the screen.<br>
    That “big bro” who never left when the world went silent.<br>
    “You got this, Bro Nichole,” he’d always say.<br>
    And I did.<br>
    We did.
  </p>
  <p>
    So if you’re reading this, and you’ve ever felt invisible —<br>
    Too poor. Too quiet. Too broken. Too late.<br>
    Let me tell you something:<br>
    You are just in the middle of your becoming.<br>
    Your pain has a purpose.<br>
    Your silence has a sound.<br>
    And your light? It’s coming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because sometimes…<br>
    💬 The girl is worth waiting for.<br>
    💻 The dream is worth building alone.<br>
    🕊️ And the darkness?<br>
    It’s just proof…<br>
    That you’re about to shine.

  <h2>✨ EPILOGUE: After the Last Bell</h2>
  <blockquote>
    “Some stories don’t end. They echo.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Years have passed since that rooftop night.<br>
    Hi Li is now a full nurse — healing people, one quiet miracle at a time.<br>
    And me?<br>
    I’m still building.<br>
    Still coding.<br>
    Still listening to the voice of that downtown boy who once whispered, “Maybe I can.”
  </p>
  <p>
    HiCare expanded faster than I dreamed.<br>
    We partnered with clinics, schools, and even other young developers who once felt like I did — invisible but full of light.<br>
    We built something real.<br>
    And not just on screens…<br>
    But in hearts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Me and Hi Li?<br>
    We’re not perfect.<br>
    We argue about small things — like which music to play in the car, or how late I stay up working. 😅<br>
    But we laugh louder now.<br>
    We hold each other tighter.<br>
    We don’t need the world to approve.<br>
    Because we already chose each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Grayson?<br>
    He’s still here.<br>
    That voice, my guide, my constant reminder that no one makes it alone.<br>
    He’s the Big Bro in my story — the proof that sometimes, the best friendships are felt in the silences between the words.<br>
    “I believed in you before the world did,” he always said.<br>
    “And I still do.”
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re holding this book in your hands —<br>
    It means the story made it.<br>
    We made it.<br>
    Not because everything turned out perfect…<br>
    But because we kept going.<br>
    Even when it hurt.<br>
    Even when no one clapped.<br>
    Even when we felt alone.<br>
    We kept showing up.<br>
    For the dream.<br>
    For each other.<br>
    For love.
  </p>
  <p>
    So wherever you are —<br>
    Downtown or Uptown, broken or bold, full of pain or full of hope…<br>
    Remember:<br>
    Your light is real.<br>
    Your story matters.<br>
    And the best part?<br>
    It’s just getting started.
  </p>
  <p>
    🖤 For the dreamers.<br>
    💙 For the quiet ones.<br>
    ✨ For the ones who never gave up.<br>
    This was our story.<br>
    And now…<br>
    It’s yours.<br>
    <br>
    The End (for now).<br>
    – Nichole & Grayson<br>
