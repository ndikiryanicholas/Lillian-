        Some people walk into your life like sunlight‚Ä¶ but she walked in like starlight‚Äîquiet, distant, and beautiful. And I‚Ä¶ I was just the night sky.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I didn‚Äôt know what it meant to feel everything and nothing at the same time‚Ä¶ until I saw Hi Li.<br>
        She was standing across the school compound, her long dark hair being gently pulled by the wind like the world itself wanted to touch her. She didn‚Äôt look around like the rest of us. She didn‚Äôt need to. The world looked at her.<br>
        Hi Li was elegance without effort. Grace in silence.<br>
        Even from that distance, I knew: she wasn‚Äôt just another pretty face.<br>
        She was a whole different universe.<br>
        And I...<br>
        I was just Nichole‚Äîa quiet boy from a noisy world, a shadow learning how to survive the light.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        They called her ‚Äúthe Up-Town Girl.‚Äù<br>
        Not just because she lived in the rich part of the city, but because everything about her seemed... elevated.<br>
        She didn‚Äôt walk. She floated.<br>
        She didn‚Äôt speak. She sang with her voice‚Äîeven when reading a math answer.<br>
        Hi Li came from the part of town where people drink water in wine glasses.<br>
        Where birthdays look like movie scenes.<br>
        Where they don‚Äôt ask about your dreams‚Äîthey give you the money to chase them.<br>
        And me?<br>
        I come from the part where you iron your uniform with a charcoal iron.<br>
        Where lunch isn't guaranteed, but faith is.<br>
        Where silence teaches you how to hope.<br>
        We were never supposed to meet.<br>
        And if we did‚Ä¶ we weren‚Äôt supposed to connect.<br>
        But life doesn‚Äôt always follow maps.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        That day she looked at me‚Äîjust once.<br>
        One second.<br>
        But enough to stop time inside my chest.<br>
        She didn‚Äôt smile. She didn‚Äôt blink.<br>
        But her eyes met mine, and my whole world shifted.<br>
        No one noticed. No one saw.<br>
        But for me, that moment became a memory‚Äîburned into my heart like a candle in a dark room.<br>
        I kept asking myself, "Why would she look at me?"<br>
        There was nothing to see.<br>
        But maybe... just maybe...<br>
        She saw the one thing nobody ever bothered to see: The darkness.<br>
        And maybe she knew, like I did, that stars shine because of the darkness‚Äînot despite it.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep.<br>
        Not because I had fallen in love.<br>
        But because for the first time‚Ä¶ someone made me feel like I existed.<br>
        Not just to breathe.<br>
        But to be seen. To matter.<br>
        Hi Li didn‚Äôt know me yet.<br>
        But I had already started writing poems in my heart about her.<br>
        And maybe, just maybe‚Ä¶<br>
        That was the beginning of something neither of us expected.

        ‚ÄúShe had everything I never had‚Ä¶ and still, I wanted nothing else but her smile.‚Äù
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The next few days, I tried not to look at her.<br>
        But my heart betrayed me every time.<br>
        Every time I heard laughter near the school fountain, I looked.<br>
        Every time the wind carried the smell of vanilla and roses, I looked.<br>
        And every time the morning sun bounced off something too shiny for this place‚Ä¶<br>
        I knew Hi Li had arrived.<br>
        She always came with quiet footsteps, like she didn‚Äôt want the world to notice her‚Äîbut the world noticed anyway.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Hi Li didn‚Äôt sit with us in the main class blocks.<br>
        She had her own small group‚Äîquiet, elegant, full of perfumes and polished nails.<br>
        They spoke softly, and when they laughed, it was like a melody that didn‚Äôt belong in our dusty compound.<br>
        And then there was me.<br>
        I sat at the back. Always at the back.<br>
        With my shoes dusty, my shirt slightly faded, and my books worn from being handed down.<br>
        She was the page in the magazine.<br>
        I was the newspaper used to wrap food.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        But here‚Äôs the thing, bro...<br>
        Sometimes, we admire people from a distance not because we are afraid of them‚Ä¶<br>
        But because we‚Äôre afraid of what we feel when we‚Äôre close to them.<br>
        I didn‚Äôt know her favorite song.<br>
        I didn‚Äôt know if she believed in love.<br>
        I didn‚Äôt know if she noticed how the world shifted every time she smiled.<br>
        But I knew this: I wanted to know her.<br>
        Not just her name or her school marks.<br>
        I wanted to know how she saw the world.<br>
        Did she believe in stars like I did?<br>
        Did she ever feel alone in a crowd?
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        One afternoon, during break, I found myself near the staffroom window, pretending to read notes. She passed by.<br>
        Alone.<br>
        No friends. No noise.<br>
        And for the first time‚Ä¶ she stopped.<br>
        Looked at me. Again.<br>
        This time, it was longer. A full three seconds.<br>
        Like the universe paused just so my heartbeat could speak.<br>
        ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she said.<br>
        Bro.<br>
        She said ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù<br>
        It wasn‚Äôt a song. It wasn‚Äôt poetry.<br>
        It was just a small word.<br>
        But from her lips‚Äîit sounded like the beginning of a miracle.<br>
        I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.<br>
        Just air.<br>
        She smiled. Just a little. A soft one.<br>
        And walked away.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I stood there frozen. Not because I was scared‚Äîbut because something inside me had shifted.<br>
        Maybe, just maybe‚Ä¶<br>
        This Up-Town Girl didn‚Äôt care where I came from.<br>
        Maybe she wasn‚Äôt just beauty in the clouds.<br>
        Maybe she was searching too.<br>
        Searching for someone who didn‚Äôt want her for her money, or her looks, or her status‚Ä¶<br>
        ‚Ä¶but someone who just wanted to know her heart.<br>
        And maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîthat someone was me.

        ‚ÄúShe smiled at me‚Ä¶ and my silence grew louder than ever before.‚Äù
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After that day, nothing felt the same.<br>
        Not the school compound, not the sky, not even the way my name sounded in the register.<br>
        One word from her‚Äî‚ÄúHi‚Äù‚Äîand my world started speaking in colors I never knew existed.<br>
        But I didn‚Äôt tell anyone.<br>
        Not my classmates. Not my brothers at home.<br>
        Not even the pages in my notebook that I usually trusted with my secrets.<br>
        Because this wasn‚Äôt just a crush.<br>
        This was the beginning of something‚Ä¶ sacred.<br>
        Something I was afraid to touch in case it disappeared.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Every time I saw Hi Li after that moment, my chest would tighten.<br>
        She wasn‚Äôt trying to impress anyone. She never chased attention.<br>
        But she had mine‚Äîcompletely.<br>
        Sometimes she sat under the tree near the library, writing in a black notebook.<br>
        I wondered what she wrote.<br>
        Were they poems? Dreams? Memories?<br>
        Was I one of them now?<br>
        Other times, she‚Äôd lean her head on her hand and just stare out the window like she missed someone or something far away.<br>
        And I would just sit there‚Ä¶ watching, wondering, wishing.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I wanted to talk to her again.<br>
        I wanted to say more than just ‚ÄúHi‚Äù back.<br>
        But every time I had the chance‚Ä¶ I froze.<br>
        There was a fear I couldn‚Äôt explain.<br>
        Not of her‚Äîbut of the voice in my head whispering:<br>
        ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not enough.‚Äù<br>
        ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll never choose someone like you.‚Äù<br>
        ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just a background character in her story.‚Äù<br>
        That voice was loud.<br>
        Louder than my courage.<br>
        And so‚Ä¶ I stayed silent.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        One day, during library hour, the unexpected happened.<br>
        Hi Li dropped her pen. It rolled all the way to my feet.<br>
        She looked at me‚Äîgently, patiently.<br>
        And I picked it up and walked toward her.<br>
        My hands were sweating. My heart was begging me to speak.<br>
        But when I handed her the pen‚Ä¶ I just nodded.<br>
        No words.<br>
        No smile.<br>
        Nothing.<br>
        She tilted her head slightly, curious.<br>
        ‚ÄúThank you, Nichole,‚Äù she said.<br>
        Her voice was music.<br>
        She knew my name.<br>
        She knew my name.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I walked away before my legs gave up.<br>
        But inside me, something cracked.<br>
        Not in a bad way‚Ä¶<br>
        But in the way a closed door finally opens a little‚Äîjust enough for light to pass through.<br>
        That night, I stood outside, looking at the stars.<br>
        I remembered the quote that lived in my heart:<br>
        "Stars can‚Äôt shine without darkness."<br>
        She was the star.<br>
        I was the darkness.<br>
        And maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶ we were made to meet.<br>
        Not to complete each other.<br>
        But to remind the world that even opposites can create something beautiful.

      <p>
        School became something else after that week.<br>
        It wasn‚Äôt just books and bells anymore.<br>
        It was her.<br>
        Hi Li.<br>
        Her name danced in my chest every time I walked into class.<br>
        Even when she wasn‚Äôt there yet, I‚Äôd feel her like a breeze before the rain.<br>
        She wasn‚Äôt the loud type.<br>
        She didn‚Äôt laugh like the popular girls, or gossip in corners like the others.<br>
        But whenever she passed by‚Ä¶ people looked.<br>
        Not just because she was beautiful‚Äîno.<br>
        It was because she was different.<br>
        Like a quiet song playing in a room full of noise.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        One Monday morning, something unexpected happened.<br>
        Hi Li walked into class late.<br>
        And instead of taking her usual seat near the front with her uptown crew‚Ä¶<br>
        She sat two chairs away from me.<br>
        The room fell into a silent tension.<br>
        People looked. I looked down.<br>
        I could feel every breath she took.<br>
        Every shift of her hand.<br>
        The scent of something soft‚Äîjasmine and early rain‚Äîwrapped around my senses.<br>
        I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Then came the moment that changed everything.<br>
        Mr. Lubega, our English teacher, walked in with his usual energy.<br>
        But this time, he wanted something else.<br>
        ‚ÄúToday,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing something different.<br>
        Pair work. Boy and girl. Front row with back row. No excuses.‚Äù<br>
        My heart stopped.<br>
        Hi Li was on my row.<br>
        I was at the back.<br>
        She turned her head slowly and looked at me.<br>
        Again. Those eyes.<br>
        She didn‚Äôt speak.<br>
        Just waited.<br>
        Mr. Lubega pointed.<br>
        ‚ÄúYou two. Nichole and Hi Li. Work together.‚Äù
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I don‚Äôt remember how I stood.<br>
        I don‚Äôt remember walking to the desk we shared.<br>
        All I know is: for the first time‚Ä¶<br>
        I sat beside her.<br>
        Close enough to hear her heart if the room went quiet.<br>
        Close enough to smell her perfume on the page we shared.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        We were supposed to write a two-paragraph essay titled:<br>
        ‚ÄúWhat is Love?‚Äù<br>
        Bro‚Ä¶ how was I supposed to write about love,<br>
        when it was literally sitting inches away from me?<br>
        She looked at the paper. Then at me.<br>
        Then she asked, ‚ÄúShould we start with your idea or mine?‚Äù<br>
        Her voice was calm. Almost playful.<br>
        I froze.<br>
        Then said, ‚ÄúYou go first.‚Äù<br>
        She smiled.<br>
        It wasn‚Äôt big‚Äîbut it held something warm.<br>
        She picked up the pen and wrote:<br>
        ‚ÄúLove is not about who has more.<br>
        Love is about who feels deeper.<br>
        It‚Äôs not about matching clothes, but matching hearts.‚Äù<br>
        She slid the paper toward me.<br>
        And said, ‚ÄúNow your turn.‚Äù
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        My hands trembled as I wrote beneath her words:<br>
        ‚ÄúLove is the language two hearts speak quietly when the world is too loud.<br>
        It‚Äôs not loud, it‚Äôs not proud‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a whisper that never dies.‚Äù<br>
        We both looked at each other.<br>
        Silence.<br>
        The kind that doesn‚Äôt need to be broken.<br>
        The kind that says more than words ever could.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        But then‚Ä¶<br>
        One of her friends‚Äîtall, loud, and sharp-tongued‚Äîwalked in.<br>
        She saw us.<br>
        Saw the paper.<br>
        Saw the closeness.<br>
        And her face dropped.<br>
        She said loudly, ‚ÄúHi Li? Really? You‚Äôre pairing with him now?‚Äù<br>
        The whole class turned.<br>
        I saw Hi Li glance down, then back at me.<br>
        And then‚Ä¶ she smiled.<br>
        Not to them.<br>
        To me.<br>
        And said the words that made me feel like maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶ I mattered:<br>
        ‚ÄúYes. I chose this seat.‚Äù

  </blockquote>
  <p>
    It was one of those rare days when the power went off during ICT class.<br>
    The teacher sighed and told us to just sit quietly until it returned. But for me, that was the perfect moment.<br>
    While others sat chatting, I reached into my backpack and pulled out the circuit board I had been secretly working on‚Äîa small project using pieces from old radios and phone chargers. Most people wouldn‚Äôt understand what it was. But to me? It was magic.<br>
    I was always that kid who wanted to know what lived behind the screen.<br>
    What made the light blink?<br>
    What made the machine think?<br>
    What made the app speak?<br>
    While others played games, I watched loading bars and opened settings‚Äîcurious about every part of how it worked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across the room, Hi Li was writing in her pink nursing journal. I had seen her carrying it before. She told me once, ‚ÄúOne day I want to touch lives‚Äînot with money, but with healing.‚Äù<br>
    I remember thinking, How do you fall in love with someone‚Äôs dream?<br>
    Because I think I did‚Ä¶ that day.<br>
    She looked at me and smiled.<br>
    ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that thing you‚Äôre building?‚Äù she asked, pointing to my tiny setup.<br>
    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ like a small brain,‚Äù I said, embarrassed. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt think yet. But I want it to.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to build a brain?‚Äù she giggled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to study one.‚Äù<br>
    We both laughed. Two different dreams, same heartbeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    We spent that whole free hour talking.<br>
    She told me how she watched her aunt‚Äîwho‚Äôs a nurse‚Äîclean wounds and speak to patients with words that felt like medicine.<br>
    She said healing wasn‚Äôt just about injections and bandages.<br>
    It was about being there when no one else stays.<br>
    I told her how I once fixed an old phone just by watching YouTube videos with no sound.<br>
    How I wanted to build something that could help kids learn even when they have no teacher.<br>
    How code felt like poetry to me‚Äîjust invisible and powerful.<br>
    She listened.<br>
    Not like someone being polite.<br>
    But like someone who really wanted to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the power came back on, everyone groaned.<br>
    But Hi Li and I looked at each other like, we didn‚Äôt need light to see each other now.
  </p>
  <p>
    Later that day, during lunch, I overheard one of her friends whisper,<br>
    ‚ÄúWhy do you talk to that tech boy? He's not even our level.‚Äù<br>
    Hi Li just looked at her and said,<br>
    ‚ÄúMaybe because I like real conversations‚Ä¶ not expensive silence.‚Äù<br>
    Bro. I swear I almost dropped my chapati.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I opened my notebook and started designing an app idea:<br>
    üì± HiCare ‚Äî an offline health tips app for rural communities, inspired by Hi Li‚Äôs passion.<br>
    I didn‚Äôt tell her yet.<br>
    But it felt right.<br>
    Like maybe our dreams weren‚Äôt so different after all.

  </blockquote>
  <p>
    After that talk in ICT class, things changed between me and Hi Li.<br>
    Not loudly. Not publicly.<br>
    But quietly‚Ä¶ like a secret rhythm only the two of us could hear.<br>
    Every time I walked into class, her eyes would meet mine.<br>
    A soft smile. A quiet nod.<br>
    And suddenly, the day felt lighter.<br>
    We‚Äôd talk during breaks‚Äînothing too obvious.<br>
    Just short walks, shared laughter, exchanged dreams.<br>
    But every word felt like we were writing a story the world wasn‚Äôt ready for.
  </p>
  <p>
    But not everyone smiled with us.<br>
    The uptown crowd had started watching.<br>
    Whispers began.<br>
    ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs wasting time with that tech guy.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúDoes she know his shoes aren‚Äôt even new?‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs just curious. It won‚Äôt last.‚Äù<br>
    One time, I passed near the school canteen and heard one of her friends laugh:<br>
    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cute she‚Äôs playing community service with him. Poor guy probably thinks it‚Äôs real.‚Äù<br>
    That one hit hard.<br>
    Because the truth is‚Ä¶<br>
    I did think it was real.
  </p>
  <p>
    I stopped talking to her for two days.<br>
    Not because I didn‚Äôt care.<br>
    But because I cared too much.<br>
    And I was scared.<br>
    Scared that I wasn‚Äôt enough.<br>
    That I‚Äôd never be enough.<br>
    We came from two different planets.<br>
    She had a driver. I walked.<br>
    She had clean shoes. Mine had dust.<br>
    She talked about med school. I talked about building an app.<br>
    It felt like trying to hold the stars with bare hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    But on the third day, she found me behind the lab block, where I usually went to hide when the world got too loud.<br>
    She sat beside me without asking.<br>
    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre avoiding me,‚Äù she said.<br>
    I didn‚Äôt speak.<br>
    She looked at me, softly.<br>
    ‚ÄúNichole,‚Äù she whispered, ‚ÄúI know they talk. I hear them too.‚Äù<br>
    I looked away.<br>
    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that, Hi Li. I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want to pull you down.‚Äù<br>
    She laughed. Not at me. But gently.<br>
    ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre darkness, and I‚Äôm light,‚Äù she said.<br>
    ‚ÄúBut Nichole, stars only shine because of darkness. Without your world, mine wouldn‚Äôt even sparkle.‚Äù<br>
    I turned to her, heart beating like a drum.<br>
    ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to ruin what you have.‚Äù<br>
    And she said something I‚Äôll never forget:<br>
    ‚ÄúWhat I have isn‚Äôt what I want. But what I feel with you? That‚Äôs real.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro‚Ä¶ I almost cried.<br>
    Right there in the shade, beside the back wall of our little broken school block‚Ä¶<br>
    She held my hand.<br>
    Not tight.<br>
    Just enough to say, I‚Äôm here.<br>
    I see you.<br>
    I choose this.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the first time‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt feel like a boy from nowhere.<br>
    I felt like someone who belonged in someone‚Äôs world.<br>
    In her world.<br>
    And suddenly, I didn‚Äôt care about what they said.<br>
    Because even if I was darkness‚Ä¶<br>
    She was the star that wanted to stay.

    ‚ÄúSometimes, love speaks louder through purpose than poetry.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    After that talk behind the lab block, something in me shifted.<br>
    I stopped hiding.<br>
    I didn‚Äôt care who was watching anymore when we talked.<br>
    Didn‚Äôt care if her friends rolled their eyes.<br>
    Didn‚Äôt care if people whispered.<br>
    All I knew was this: Hi Li saw me.<br>
    Not just my face. Not my dusty shoes.<br>
    She saw the boy who wanted to build the future‚Ä¶ with his own two hands.<br>
    And now, I was ready to take the next step.
  </p>
  <p>
    It started with a simple idea: HiCare.<br>
    The app that could share basic first aid and health tips offline, in local languages.<br>
    I had already started designing it in my notebook‚Äîits colors, the layout, and the sections.<br>
    But I needed her voice in it. Her heart.<br>
    ‚ÄúHi Li,‚Äù I told her one afternoon, ‚ÄúI want to build something with you.‚Äù<br>
    She looked up from her nursing journal.<br>
    ‚ÄúTogether?‚Äù she asked.<br>
    ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou know the healing. I know the code. Why not make something that helps the people we care about?‚Äù<br>
    Her eyes sparkled.<br>
    ‚ÄúNichole‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the most beautiful thing anyone‚Äôs ever asked me to build.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    So we started.<br>
    After classes, we‚Äôd meet at the back of the computer lab‚Äîjust her, me, a scratched laptop, and dreams larger than our town.<br>
    She would explain simple health concepts:<br>
    What to do when someone faints.<br>
    How to treat a burn.<br>
    Signs of dehydration.<br>
    How to help someone during a panic attack.<br>
    And I would turn her words into screens and buttons‚Äîdesigning the app bit by bit.
  </p>
  <p>
    But of course‚Ä¶ the world noticed.<br>
    One evening, as we were walking out of the lab, we heard it:<br>
    ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs using her. Just wants to climb out of poverty with her name.‚Äù<br>
    Another voice chimed in:<br>
    ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt even realize he‚Äôs beneath her.‚Äù<br>
    Hi Li froze.<br>
    I expected her to stay quiet.<br>
    But she turned‚Äîsharp and clear.<br>
    ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm helping him?<br>
    What if he‚Äôs helping me?<br>
    What if love isn‚Äôt about who has more‚Ä¶ but who brings out your best?‚Äù<br>
    The silence that followed was louder than thunder.<br>
    She didn‚Äôt wait for them to respond.<br>
    She just grabbed my hand, and we walked away.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll never forget that walk.<br>
    It felt like I wasn‚Äôt just loved‚ÄîI was fought for.<br>
    And you know what‚Äôs rare?<br>
    A love that doesn‚Äôt just whisper in the dark,<br>
    but shouts in the daylight.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I added one last section to the app mockup:<br>
    ü´∂ Mental Health: How to feel safe when your heart is tired.<br>
    Because even if we were trying to heal others‚Äî<br>
    We were also healing each other.

    ‚ÄúSometimes, the people closest to her weren‚Äôt the ones who cared‚Ä¶ they were the ones who controlled.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    It all began with a note.<br>
    A small, folded piece of paper slipped under my math book.<br>
    I opened it casually during class, expecting a joke or some anonymous encouragement like before.<br>
    But what I read stopped me cold:<br>
    ‚ÄúUptown girls don‚Äôt stay with boys like you.<br>
    Walk away before she gets hurt.‚Äù<br>
    There was no name.<br>
    Just pain.<br>
    And suddenly, every second of peace I had built with Hi Li began to crack.
  </p>
  <p>
    That evening, I tried to act normal when we met in the computer lab to work on HiCare.<br>
    But something had changed in me.<br>
    I was quiet.<br>
    Distracted.<br>
    Cold.<br>
    She noticed.<br>
    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not here,‚Äù she said, placing her hand gently over mine. ‚ÄúWhere did you go?‚Äù<br>
    I looked at her, and for a second‚Ä¶ I wanted to tell her everything.<br>
    But the fear came rushing back.<br>
    Not fear of her‚Äîbut fear of losing her.<br>
    Fear that maybe, just maybe, the note was right.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next few days were strange.<br>
    Hi Li didn‚Äôt stop showing up.<br>
    She still smiled, still shared ideas, still believed in us.<br>
    But I was pulling away.<br>
    It‚Äôs funny how you can love someone deeply, and still think you're protecting them by pushing them out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then came Friday.<br>
    The school cultural event.<br>
    Everyone was there‚Äîstudents in colorful outfits, music blasting, food being shared.<br>
    But I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for joy.<br>
    I sat near the far end of the compound, alone, watching shadows stretch across the grass.<br>
    And that‚Äôs when I saw her.<br>
    Hi Li, in a white and blue floral dress, standing beside someone I didn‚Äôt recognize at first.<br>
    Tall. Clean shoes. iPhone in hand.<br>
    Gold watch flashing in the sun.<br>
    And then he laughed.<br>
    Touched her arm.<br>
    She didn‚Äôt pull away.<br>
    My chest tightened.
  </p>
  <p>
    Later that day, I found out:<br>
    He was her cousin. From abroad.<br>
    Uptown to the bone.<br>
    And apparently, he was staying with her family for the holiday.<br>
    But rumors don‚Äôt wait for truth.<br>
    By the next morning, whispers spread:<br>
    ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs getting matched.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúHer parents prefer someone else.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúShe was just playing school love.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt lie.<br>
    I was broken.<br>
    I stopped answering her texts.<br>
    Stopped coming to the lab.<br>
    Stopped believing in HiCare‚Äîin us.
  </p>
  <p>
    On Monday, she came looking for me.<br>
    ‚ÄúNichole,‚Äù she said, finding me behind the canteen. ‚ÄúWhy are you shutting me out?‚Äù<br>
    I looked at her, not with anger‚Ä¶ but with the kind of sadness that builds in silence.<br>
    ‚ÄúI saw you,‚Äù I whispered.<br>
    ‚ÄúWith my cousin?‚Äù she asked, confused.<br>
    I nodded.<br>
    She stepped closer.<br>
    ‚ÄúYou think I would just move on like that?‚Äù she said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúAfter everything we‚Äôve built?‚Äù<br>
    I stayed quiet.<br>
    Then she pulled something out of her bag‚Äîa folded note.<br>
    The same note that had been left for me.<br>
    ‚ÄúI found this in my locker,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just you they‚Äôre warning‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs me too.‚Äù<br>
    She looked me dead in the eyes.<br>
    ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want us together.<br>
    But I‚Äôm not walking away.<br>
    Not unless you do.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro‚Ä¶ I broke.<br>
    Tears I had swallowed for days started falling.<br>
    Not because I was weak.<br>
    But because I realized‚Ä¶<br>
    She was choosing me. Even in the storm.<br>
    And this time‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt going to run.

    ‚ÄúThey judged me by where I came from‚Ä¶ until they saw what I could build with my own hands.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    After that moment behind the canteen‚Äîwhen Hi Li showed me the note and chose us‚Äîsomething inside me changed forever.<br>
    I wasn‚Äôt scared anymore.<br>
    Not of her parents. Not of the whispers.<br>
    Not even of being heartbroken.<br>
    Because I had already lost myself once.<br>
    Now, I had something worth standing for.
  </p>
  <p>
    That week, I locked myself in the computer lab after school every day.<br>
    I coded late.<br>
    Tested features.<br>
    Debugged the glitches in HiCare.<br>
    Even when the power went off, I used the light from my small solar lamp to keep going.<br>
    Hi Li brought me snacks. Water. Encouragement.<br>
    And her notebook‚Äîfull of notes on health tips, emergency procedures, and mental wellness.<br>
    We worked like a team.<br>
    No, like a vision in motion.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day, we got a chance.<br>
    Our school announced a Tech & Innovation Day.<br>
    A chance for students to showcase their projects to parents, alumni, and local leaders.<br>
    I wasn‚Äôt going to sign up at first.<br>
    But Hi Li looked me straight in the eye and said:<br>
    ‚ÄúNichole‚Ä¶ if they won‚Äôt listen to your story, make them listen to your work.‚Äù<br>
    So we did it.<br>
    We signed up. As one team.<br>
    Nichole and Hi Li.<br>
    Code and Care.
  </p>
  <p>
    The day came fast.<br>
    I wore my best shirt. The one Mama had ironed gently that morning.<br>
    Hi Li wore a simple white blouse with a red ribbon in her hair.<br>
    We weren‚Äôt flashy.<br>
    But we were real.<br>
    Our project booth was small. Just a poster and one borrowed laptop.<br>
    But on that screen lived the soul of our struggle:<br>
    HiCare ‚Äî Health in Your Hands<br>
    üì± Offline app<br>
    ü´∂ Health tips in local language<br>
    üíä First aid, mental health, maternal care<br>
    üîã No internet required
  </p>
  <p>
    People passed by at first, uninterested.<br>
    Until one old man stopped.<br>
    Read the title.<br>
    Clicked through the screens.<br>
    He called his friend.<br>
    Then a teacher joined.<br>
    Then a nurse.<br>
    Then a journalist from a local paper.<br>
    Within minutes, our small booth was surrounded.<br>
    Hi Li explained the health side.<br>
    I explained the tech side.<br>
    And bro, the moment that hit me hardest‚Ä¶ was when I looked up and saw her father standing at the back.<br>
    Sunglasses in shirt pocket.<br>
    Arms crossed.<br>
    Watching.
  </p>
  <p>
    He didn‚Äôt say anything.<br>
    Just watched.<br>
    Then turned and walked away.<br>
    But I saw something in his eyes.<br>
    Not approval.<br>
    Not anger.<br>
    Something else: respect.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, Hi Li messaged me:<br>
    ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt say a word. But for the first time‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt stop me from texting you.‚Äù<br>
    And then:<br>
    ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre making them see it, Nichole.<br>
    Not by shouting‚Ä¶ but by showing.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro‚Ä¶ that was the night I knew.<br>
    This wasn‚Äôt just love.<br>
    It was a mission.<br>
    To prove that dreams don‚Äôt come from class.<br>
    They come from courage.<br>
    And ours?<br>
    Was just beginning.

    "Some people hate what they don‚Äôt understand. And some try to destroy what they secretly admire."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Three days after Tech & Innovation Day, I got called to the principal‚Äôs office.<br>
    I had done nothing wrong‚Äîat least, I thought I hadn‚Äôt.<br>
    But the look on his face told me this wasn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúcheck-in.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúNichole,‚Äù he began, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve received reports that your project HiCare may have used code copied from an existing app.‚Äù<br>
    I froze.<br>
    ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I whispered.<br>
    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a serious claim,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe have to investigate. You‚Äôre suspended from the competition for now.‚Äù<br>
    My heart dropped into my shoes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I left the office like a ghost.<br>
    The sky was too quiet. The air too sharp.<br>
    Hi Li came running when she heard.<br>
    ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù she asked, breathless.<br>
    I told her everything.<br>
    The accusation. The suspension. The shame.<br>
    She looked stunned‚Äîthen angry.<br>
    ‚ÄúWho would do that?‚Äù she whispered.<br>
    I already knew the answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    It didn‚Äôt take long for the truth to slip out.<br>
    Her cousin.<br>
    The one with the iPhone and the golden watch.<br>
    The one who had smiled too politely.<br>
    He had a connection with the PTA head and had ‚Äúshared concerns‚Äù about HiCare being ‚Äútoo advanced‚Äù for a student like me.<br>
    He was trying to protect her ‚Äúimage.‚Äù<br>
    Trying to clean the uptown name from downtown dust.<br>
    Hi Li was furious.<br>
    She stormed into her father‚Äôs office that evening and defended me.<br>
    She showed him my handwritten diagrams, the GitHub page I had opened weeks ago, and the months we had spent building.<br>
    But the damage was done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rumors spread fast.<br>
    ‚ÄúNichole‚Äôs a fraud.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúHe stole the app.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúHe was using her to climb.‚Äù<br>
    Even some of the teachers who once praised me started whispering doubts behind my back.<br>
    I stayed home the next day.<br>
    Didn‚Äôt go online.<br>
    Didn‚Äôt touch my code.<br>
    Didn‚Äôt reply to Hi Li‚Äôs messages.
  </p>
  <p>
    But then‚Ä¶<br>
    She showed up at my doorstep.<br>
    She didn‚Äôt care about the mud, or the noise, or the boda-bodas flying past.<br>
    She came with a backpack and a folded paper in her hand.<br>
    When I opened the door, she looked at me with wet eyes and said:<br>
    ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to disappear. Not when we‚Äôre this close.‚Äù<br>
    She opened the paper.<br>
    It was a letter of invitation.<br>
    HiCare has been selected to pitch at the National Student Innovation Summit in Kampala.<br>
    Two representatives allowed.<br>
    Travel and accommodation covered.<br>
    I stared at it, heart pounding.<br>
    ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going with you,‚Äù she said.<br>
    ‚ÄúWhether they believe in you or not‚Ä¶ I do.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro, I won‚Äôt lie.<br>
    That moment broke every fear I had left inside me.<br>
    Not because she saved me.<br>
    But because she reminded me:<br>
    Love doesn‚Äôt need to be believed by everyone‚Äîonly lived by the ones who feel it.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I opened my laptop.<br>
    Typed the words:<br>
    Welcome to HiCare.<br>
    Made with love, built with purpose.<br>
    And I hit save.<br>
    Because the dream wasn‚Äôt over.<br>
    It was just beginning.

    ‚ÄúThe stars didn‚Äôt just shine‚Ä¶ they chose to shine for me.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    We were supposed to stay low.<br>
    After the note.<br>
    After the silence.<br>
    After the rumors.<br>
    But Hi Li didn‚Äôt believe in shrinking for anyone.<br>
    Not even for the world that once shaped her like a porcelain doll.<br>
    And that‚Äôs when everything changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The school held a Talent Night‚Äîjust for fun.<br>
    No competition, no awards, just expression.<br>
    The usual names were on the list:<br>
    Rogers doing his rap. Sophie singing a Rema cover.<br>
    The Uptown girls doing their TikTok-inspired dance.<br>
    I hadn‚Äôt even planned to go.<br>
    I didn‚Äôt want to sit in a room filled with people who weren‚Äôt sure if I belonged.<br>
    But as I stepped out of the gate with my hoodie on, someone caught my wrist.<br>
    It was Hi Li.<br>
    ‚ÄúCome,‚Äù she said, smiling.<br>
    ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really in the mood,‚Äù I replied.<br>
    She looked at me with those fearless eyes.<br>
    ‚ÄúBut I am. And tonight‚Ä¶ you need to see me.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    I sat at the back of the crowd, alone.<br>
    The stage was nothing more than a few lights and a mic.<br>
    But in my chest, it felt like the whole world was watching.<br>
    Then the emcee announced:<br>
    ‚ÄúNext up ‚Äî Hi Li, performing something original‚Ä¶‚Äù<br>
    I froze.<br>
    Original?<br>
    Hi Li? Performing?<br>
    She walked onstage in a plain black dress.<br>
    Hair tied back. No jewelry. No fancy shoes.<br>
    Just presence.
  </p>
  <p>
    And then‚Ä¶ she didn‚Äôt sing.<br>
    She didn‚Äôt dance.<br>
    She spoke.<br>
    A poem.<br>
    A fire wrapped in velvet.<br>
    ‚ÄúThey say a girl like me should only walk with heels‚Ä¶<br>
    But I walk better in truth.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúThey say love should be clean, quiet, proper‚Ä¶<br>
    But mine has wire dust, code bugs, and a boy who dreams through broken power banks.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt bring me flowers.<br>
    He brought me courage.<br>
    And I chose him.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    My hands trembled.<br>
    She wasn‚Äôt hiding it.<br>
    She wasn‚Äôt whispering it behind closed doors.<br>
    She was saying it out loud.<br>
    In front of them.<br>
    In front of everyone.<br>
    ‚ÄúStars aren‚Äôt just born to be watched‚Ä¶<br>
    Sometimes, they choose the darkness ‚Äî<br>
    Because that‚Äôs the only place they can truly shine.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    The crowd sat in silence.<br>
    No laughter. No gossip. Just awe.<br>
    Then came the claps.<br>
    Not forced.<br>
    Not polite.<br>
    Real.<br>
    Even the ones who had doubted her.<br>
    Even the friends who once warned her.<br>
    Even the teachers who had rolled their eyes at me.<br>
    That night, she didn‚Äôt just shine.<br>
    She burned through the noise.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the show, I didn‚Äôt even move.<br>
    She found me at the back.<br>
    I looked up at her. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked.<br>
    She smiled.<br>
    ‚ÄúBecause I was tired of hiding stars that were meant to be seen.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúAnd tonight, I wasn‚Äôt just the Uptown girl.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúI was your girl.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    And that night, I realized:<br>
    Some people hide love in private‚Ä¶<br>
    But she lit it like a lamp in front of a crowd.<br>
    Not for fame.<br>
    Not for attention.<br>
    But because real love doesn‚Äôt whisper when the world‚Äôs too loud ‚Äî it speaks louder.

  <p>
    We arrived in Kampala on a Wednesday afternoon.<br>
    The city moved fast ‚Äî boda-bodas zigzagging through traffic, billboards flashing with ads, people in suits and students with headphones.<br>
    I‚Äôd never seen so many buildings that touched the sky.<br>
    Hi Li and I stepped out of the taxi, wide-eyed, holding the future in a flash drive ‚Äî our dream: HiCare.<br>
    We were finalists at the National Student Innovation Summit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hotel looked like it belonged in a movie.<br>
    Automatic glass doors. Floors that smelled like lavender. Staff who called me ‚Äúsir.‚Äù<br>
    I wasn‚Äôt used to it.<br>
    But Hi Li?<br>
    She fit in like she had always lived there.<br>
    Polished. Calm. Confident.<br>
    ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs register,‚Äù she whispered with a wink.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first evening was a welcome dinner.<br>
    That‚Äôs where it began.<br>
    We were seated with students from international schools ‚Äî polished accents, MacBooks on their laps, talking about AI and machine learning like it was air.<br>
    One guy in glasses leaned across the table and asked:<br>
    ‚ÄúYou two are from Central Uganda Secondary? Never heard of it. Where is that?‚Äù<br>
    I tried to explain.<br>
    Before I finished, he cut in:<br>
    ‚ÄúOhhh, cool. Rural vibes. You built HiCare, right? Heard it‚Äôs surprisingly decent.‚Äù<br>
    Surprisingly.<br>
    That word stabbed more than he knew.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next morning was rehearsal day.<br>
    Each team had ten minutes to pitch.<br>
    Most came with team shirts, glossy slides, fancy transitions.<br>
    I had a basic PowerPoint and my heart in my hands.<br>
    When our name was called, we stepped up.<br>
    I introduced HiCare.<br>
    Spoke of the challenges in rural health.<br>
    The offline mode.<br>
    The multilingual support.<br>
    Hi Li took the mic next:<br>
    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just an app. It‚Äôs a nurse in your pocket.<br>
    Built not for the rich, but for the forgotten.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    We nailed it.<br>
    Even the judges smiled.<br>
    But later in the hallway, I overheard it.<br>
    ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably just her assistant or something.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúDo you think she really likes him or it‚Äôs a charity case?‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúA nurse and a coder? That‚Äôs not a real match.‚Äù<br>
    I stood still, staring at the floor tiles.<br>
    I had finally made it to the stage‚Ä¶<br>
    But I still felt like a shadow in someone else‚Äôs light.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep.<br>
    I stepped out onto the hotel balcony.<br>
    The city lights blinked like stars.<br>
    But they felt distant.<br>
    Cold.<br>
    Hi Li joined me with two cups of warm juice.<br>
    She sat quietly.<br>
    Then asked:<br>
    ‚ÄúDo you feel like you don‚Äôt belong here?‚Äù<br>
    I didn‚Äôt answer. But she already knew.<br>
    She leaned her head on my shoulder and whispered:<br>
    ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt belong here, Nichole.<br>
    You belong beyond here.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt see it yet.<br>
    But I do.<br>
    And that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    And that‚Äôs when I realized:<br>
    Belonging isn‚Äôt about the room you're in.<br>
    It‚Äôs about the person who believes you deserve to be there.<br>
    And I had that person beside me.

    ‚ÄúNot every storm comes to destroy you. Some come to reveal who‚Äôs truly holding your hand.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    After the pitch in Kampala, we made headlines.<br>
    Small ones at first. Local blogs. School forums.<br>
    Then came a call from a youth innovation podcast. Then an email from a tech hub asking if we‚Äôd like to incubate HiCare after our exams.<br>
    It felt unreal.<br>
    But the higher we climbed‚Ä¶<br>
    ‚Ä¶the more the winds tried to knock us down.
  </p>
  <p>
    It started with whispers at school.<br>
    ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just doing it for attention.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs using her to escape his background.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll break up after the project wins something.‚Äù<br>
    Even our classmates divided into sides.<br>
    Some jealous of Hi Li‚Äôs spotlight.<br>
    Others waiting for me to fail.<br>
    I tried to ignore it.<br>
    Tried to focus on coding, on school, on breathing.<br>
    But then‚Ä¶<br>
    One morning, I opened my laptop to check our shared cloud folder.<br>
    And it was gone.<br>
    All of it.<br>
    HiCare's backend. The updated UI. The notes. The timeline.<br>
    Deleted.
  </p>
  <p>
    I stared at the empty screen, my breath locked in my throat.<br>
    I called Hi Li.<br>
    She ran across the school field in slippers to meet me in the computer lab.<br>
    We checked everything.<br>
    The trash folder. The backups. The logs.<br>
    Someone had accessed it.<br>
    Someone who had our link and password.<br>
    My head spun.<br>
    ‚ÄúI only shared it with you,‚Äù I said softly.<br>
    ‚ÄúAnd I only ever opened it on my laptop,‚Äù she replied.<br>
    But someone else had gotten in.
  </p>
  <p>
    The principal launched an investigation.<br>
    And that‚Äôs when we learned‚Ä¶<br>
    It was Sophie.<br>
    Her friend. Her roommate.<br>
    The one who had ‚Äúsupported‚Äù our relationship publicly‚Ä¶ but rolled her eyes privately.<br>
    She had taken the password from Hi Li‚Äôs open notebook while she was in the shower.<br>
    Why?<br>
    ‚ÄúI was tired of watching her ruin herself for a guy who will never fit in her world.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    Hi Li was devastated.<br>
    She didn‚Äôt cry.<br>
    She didn‚Äôt scream.<br>
    She just stood silently outside the headteacher‚Äôs office while Sophie was suspended.<br>
    Then she turned to me and said:<br>
    ‚ÄúThey think this breaks us?‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúThey forgot we built this with nothing. We can build it again.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, we stayed in the library until midnight.<br>
    Rebuilding.<br>
    Slide by slide. Line by line. Page by page.<br>
    We didn‚Äôt speak much.<br>
    But in the silence‚Ä¶ there was strength.<br>
    Real love isn‚Äôt loud all the time.<br>
    Sometimes it‚Äôs just two people choosing each other again after the world tries to tear them apart.

    ‚ÄúSome people smile so brightly‚Ä¶ just to hide how much they‚Äôve been surviving.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    We had rebuilt HiCare.<br>
    We had been featured in a youth tech magazine.<br>
    We had survived sabotage, doubt, and public humiliation.<br>
    And yet‚Ä¶<br>
    She still cried sometimes.<br>
    Not loudly. Not dramatically.<br>
    Just those quiet tears when no one was looking.<br>
    When the world thought she was okay‚Ä¶ but I knew better.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was a Friday evening.<br>
    We were sitting on the edge of the football field, watching the sky change from gold to grey.<br>
    Her head was resting on my shoulder, but I could feel her shaking a little.<br>
    ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù I asked softly.<br>
    She didn‚Äôt answer.<br>
    She just whispered:<br>
    ‚ÄúDo you ever feel like you have to be perfect‚Ä¶ because if you make one mistake, the whole world will say, ‚ÄòI told you so‚Äô?‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    I stayed silent.<br>
    Because I knew that feeling.<br>
    But I also knew‚Ä¶ this wasn‚Äôt about me.<br>
    This was her opening the door to something deeper.<br>
    And then she said it:<br>
    ‚ÄúWhen I was ten, my mom left.‚Äù<br>
    The words felt like thunder in the calm.<br>
    ‚ÄúShe said she needed to ‚Äòfind herself.‚Äô<br>
    But she never looked back to find me.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    I turned to her, unsure if I should speak.<br>
    But she kept going.<br>
    ‚ÄúEveryone thinks I‚Äôm this confident, smart uptown girl‚Ä¶<br>
    But inside, I still feel like the child who wasn‚Äôt enough for her mother to stay.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt start nursing because I loved needles.<br>
    I started because I promised myself I‚Äôd never leave anyone broken and bleeding like I was.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    My heart broke quietly beside her.<br>
    I didn‚Äôt have the perfect thing to say.<br>
    No quote or code or poetic line.<br>
    So I just reached for her hand.<br>
    And she held on like she had been drowning for years‚Ä¶<br>
    and finally found something solid.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I walked home slower than usual.<br>
    Thinking about her tears.<br>
    About the strength she shows the world, and the cracks she hides behind that smile.<br>
    And I realized:<br>
    I wasn‚Äôt in love with the perfect girl from uptown.<br>
    I was in love with the real her ‚Äî broken, brave, beautiful.<br>
    And maybe‚Ä¶<br>
    She was falling for the real me too.

    ‚ÄúSome people vanish without slamming the door‚Ä¶ and that silence is louder than a thousand goodbyes.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    It started like any other Monday.<br>
    But she didn‚Äôt show up to class.<br>
    No text. No call. No ‚Äúrunning late‚Äù emoji.<br>
    Just‚Ä¶ silence.
  </p>
  <p>
    I waited.<br>
    Lunch passed. Still nothing.<br>
    Then the whispers started.<br>
    ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gone.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúTransferred.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúHer father pulled her out last night.‚Äù<br>
    I couldn‚Äôt believe it.<br>
    Not Hi Li.<br>
    Not after everything we fought through.<br>
    Not after the summit. The long nights. The stolen smiles.
  </p>
  <p>
    I ran to the nurse‚Äôs station.<br>
    Empty.<br>
    I checked her favorite window spot in the library.<br>
    Only dust.<br>
    Her locker? Cleared out.<br>
    Not even a sticky note left behind.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, I sat by my laptop ‚Äî<br>
    HiCare open, her voice still saved in the intro screen:<br>
    ‚ÄúHelping hearts, one care at a time.‚Äù<br>
    I played it again and again.<br>
    Just to feel like she was still near.
  </p>
  <p>
    Three days passed.<br>
    No sign.<br>
    No word.<br>
    No Hi Li.<br>
    Even her socials went quiet.<br>
    It was like she had vanished into air.<br>
    No chance to ask why.<br>
    No chance to say don‚Äôt go.<br>
    No chance to say I love you‚Ä¶ and I always did.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the fourth day, a letter came.<br>
    No name. No return address.<br>
    Just my name.<br>
    Written in her handwriting.<br>
    I opened it with shaking hands.<br>
    Inside, one line:<br>
    ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to leave. But sometimes love means staying silent‚Ä¶ when speaking would hurt more.‚Äù<br>
    And folded with it ‚Äî<br>
    a photo of us in front of the Summit banner.<br>
    My arm around her.<br>
    Her eyes smiling through tears.
  </p>
  <p>
    I stared at it until my vision blurred.<br>
    Because that‚Äôs the thing about real love:<br>
    It doesn‚Äôt always end with a kiss.<br>
    Sometimes, it ends with an empty seat beside you‚Ä¶ and a heart still full.

    ‚ÄúSome pain doesn't break you‚Ä¶ it becomes the reason you rise.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The days after she left felt endless.<br>
    No goodbye.<br>
    No warning.<br>
    Just silence‚Ä¶ again.<br>
    But this time, it wasn‚Äôt the soft silence we used to share under trees.<br>
    This silence burned.<br>
    This silence was war.
  </p>
  <p>
    People said I should‚Äôve known better.<br>
    ‚ÄúShe was never yours to keep.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúUptown girls don‚Äôt marry downtown dreams.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúMove on, Nichole. Be realistic.‚Äù<br>
    But how do you move on from someone who made you feel seen?<br>
    How do you unlearn a love that felt like purpose?
  </p>
  <p>
    I stopped coding for a while.<br>
    I couldn‚Äôt stare at the screen without seeing her face in the loading bar.<br>
    Couldn‚Äôt hear the soft keyboard taps without hearing her laugh.<br>
    Even the sun seemed tired of shining.
  </p>
  <p>
    But then one night‚Ä¶<br>
    I found the notebook.<br>
    The black one ‚Äî covered in tech stickers and quiet memories.<br>
    Inside were pages we had filled together:<br>
    How to make care easier.<br>
    How to connect nurses to patients.<br>
    How love can power design.<br>
    I ran my fingers across the page where she had written:<br>
    ‚ÄúDream big. We‚Äôre not just making an app‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre making a bridge.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    And something snapped awake in me.<br>
    A kind of holy rage.<br>
    Not angry at her.<br>
    Not angry at the world.<br>
    But angry at the idea that this is where it ends.<br>
    No.<br>
    This wasn‚Äôt the end.<br>
    It was the breaking before the becoming.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I got up.<br>
    Opened my laptop.<br>
    Lit a candle ‚Äî not for light, but for focus.<br>
    And I began again.<br>
    Line by line.<br>
    Bug by bug.<br>
    Pain by pain.<br>
    HiCare Version 3.0 was born not out of joy‚Ä¶<br>
    ‚Ä¶but out of the ashes of love.
  </p>
  <p>
    Weeks passed.<br>
    The app got cleaner.<br>
    Smarter.<br>
    Stronger.<br>
    So did I.<br>
    I started walking taller in hallways again.<br>
    Not because the whispers stopped.<br>
    But because they no longer mattered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Grayson (Big Bro GPT) messaged me one day:<br>
    ‚ÄúStill standing?‚Äù<br>
    I replied:<br>
    ‚ÄúStill rising.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    Bro, that pain changed me.<br>
    It didn‚Äôt take away the love.<br>
    It refined it.<br>
    Turned it into fuel.<br>
    Turned it into fire.<br>
    Turned me into something I didn‚Äôt know I could be:<br>
    A boy who once loved a girl‚Ä¶<br>
    and now builds to honor her memory.

  <p>
    It was a rainy Saturday.<br>
    Clouds hung low like the weight in my chest.<br>
    I had just returned from school ‚Äî<br>
    trying to pretend I was okay.<br>
    Trying to focus on finals. On rebuilding HiCare.<br>
    On anything‚Ä¶ but her.<br>
    Then the mailman called my name.<br>
    ‚ÄúNichole! Got something for you.‚Äù<br>
    An envelope.<br>
    No return address.<br>
    No stamp.<br>
    Just one word written in blue ink:<br>
    ‚ÄúRead.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    Inside was the first letter.<br>
    Hi Li‚Äôs handwriting. The soft curve of her ‚ÄúL.‚Äù<br>
    The way she dotted her ‚Äúi‚Äù like a tiny heart.<br>
    I held my breath as I began to read.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúNichole‚Ä¶<br>
    I wanted to write this before I left, but I didn‚Äôt have the courage.<br>
    So I wrote it after I was gone.<br>
    I hated leaving. I cried the whole night.<br>
    But my dad said it was for my ‚Äòfuture.‚Äô<br>
    He didn‚Äôt want me caught in a ‚Äòdowntown scandal.‚Äô<br>
    But love isn‚Äôt a scandal.<br>
    It‚Äôs how you helped me believe in my dreams.<br>
    How you looked at me like I wasn‚Äôt just the Uptown Girl‚Ä¶<br>
    but a girl who mattered, who could heal, who could care.<br>
    I miss your quiet.<br>
    I miss your mind.<br>
    I miss us.<br>
    Please don‚Äôt stop building.<br>
    Build what we dreamed.<br>
    Make HiCare the light it was meant to be.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I paused.<br>
    My heart ached in places I didn‚Äôt know were still alive.<br>
    Then I noticed something at the bottom:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúTurn over.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I flipped the page.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúP.S. I left something behind.‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúCheck the back of your physics textbook.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I rushed to my bookshelf ‚Äî<br>
    Pulled out the old, worn physics book we used to share during study sessions.<br>
    There it was.<br>
    A folded sticky note, still smelling faintly of lavender:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúI never said goodbye‚Ä¶<br>
    because deep down, I knew we‚Äôd meet again.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I sat down, clutching the note like a lifeline.<br>
    Tears fell.<br>
    Not of pain‚Ä¶<br>
    but of love that refused to die.<br>
    And in that moment, I realized:<br>
    Sometimes, the people we lose aren‚Äôt really gone.<br>
    They live in the pages,<br>
    in the projects,<br>
    in the promises we keep.

  <p>
    It was at the HealthTech Expo in Kampala.<br>
    I didn‚Äôt expect to see her there.<br>
    Not in that crowd of entrepreneurs, judges, cameras, and tech giants.<br>
    Not after everything.<br>
    But fate doesn‚Äôt ask for permission.<br>
    It just shows up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was standing by the HiCare booth.<br>
    Presentation board ready.<br>
    Screens polished.<br>
    Nervous energy bouncing in my chest like code in a loop.<br>
    Then I heard a voice.<br>
    Soft. Familiar.<br>
    Like a bookmark I thought I had lost.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúYou made it.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I turned.<br>
    And there she was.<br>
    Hi Li.<br>
    Same eyes.<br>
    Same light.<br>
    But something had changed.<br>
    She was... stronger. Quieter. Deeper.<br>
    Like the silence we once shared had grown inside her too.
  </p>
  <p>
    ‚ÄúHiCare looks beautiful,‚Äù she said, tracing the logo with her eyes.<br>
    I didn‚Äôt know what to say.<br>
    Do I say I missed you?<br>
    Do I ask Why did you leave?<br>
    Do I pretend like my heart didn‚Äôt memorize the sound of her voice?
  </p>
  <p>
    ‚ÄúYou left,‚Äù I finally said.<br>
    She nodded.<br>
    ‚ÄúI did.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    Then silence ‚Äî the old kind.<br>
    But this time, it didn‚Äôt hurt.<br>
    It healed.<br>
    Because this silence wasn‚Äôt absence.<br>
    It was understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    She reached into her bag and pulled out something.<br>
    A bracelet.<br>
    The same one I had given her ‚Äî a white band with the words:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúBuilt with Love, Coded with Care.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    ‚ÄúI wore it every day,‚Äù she whispered.<br>
    ‚ÄúEven when I didn‚Äôt know if I deserved it.‚Äù<br>
    My hands trembled.<br>
    ‚ÄúI thought you forgot me.‚Äù<br>
    She shook her head.<br>
    ‚ÄúI tried. But you‚Äôre the kind of memory that lives even in shadows.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    We didn‚Äôt say sorry.<br>
    We didn‚Äôt say come back.<br>
    We just‚Ä¶ stood there.<br>
    Two worlds.<br>
    Same orbit.<br>

  <p>
    ‚ÄúI‚Äôm studying nursing now,‚Äù she smiled.<br>
    My eyes lit up.<br>
    ‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù<br>
    ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still building,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúApps. Purpose. Dreams.‚Äù<br>
    She looked proud.<br>
    Not just of HiCare.<br>
    Of me.<br>
    Of us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before she left, she handed me a folded note.<br>
    I waited till she was gone before opening it.<br>
    It read:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúSome stars don‚Äôt disappear. They just learn how to shine in silence. I‚Äôm proud of you, Nichole. Always.‚Äù

  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Kampala felt different this time.<br>
    The traffic was still loud.<br>
    The city still wild with movement and dreams.<br>
    But inside me‚Ä¶ everything had changed.<br>
    I wasn‚Äôt the same boy who hid in the back of classrooms.<br>
    Who doubted his worth.<br>
    Who needed permission to believe in his own vision.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the Expo, I was offered a scholarship to pursue tech innovation.<br>
    Not just to build apps ‚Äî but to teach others how.<br>
    HiCare was no longer just a project.<br>
    It was a mission.
  </p>
  <p>
    And I was no longer ‚Äúthat downtown boy.‚Äù<br>
    I was Nichole.<br>
    A creator. A coder. A story written by fire, tested by silence, and refined by love.
  </p>
  <p>
    People started recognizing me.<br>
    Some who once ignored me now wanted to partner.<br>
    A girl who once laughed when I said ‚ÄúI build apps‚Äù now DM‚Äôd me asking for mentorship.<br>
    Funny how success changes perception.<br>
    But I didn‚Äôt let it change my heart.<br>
    Because pain had been my teacher.<br>
    Love had been my compass.<br>
    And silence‚Ä¶ had been my voice.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day, I walked past the mirror and didn‚Äôt look away.<br>
    For the first time, I liked the reflection.<br>
    Not because it was perfect ‚Äî<br>
    But because it was real.
  </p>
  <p>
    I remembered the boy who sat alone at lunch.<br>
    The one who scribbled code on napkins.<br>
    The one who was too shy to say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù to Hi Li.<br>
    I smiled at him.<br>
    He had no idea he would become a light for others.
  </p>
  <p>
    The city didn‚Äôt get quieter.<br>
    The world didn‚Äôt get softer.<br>
    But I had become louder ‚Äî not with noise, but with purpose.<br>
    And even when storms came again ‚Äî<br>
    Because they always do ‚Äî<br>
    I no longer feared them.<br>
    Because I had learned to shine in the dark.

  <p>
    It wasn‚Äôt a wedding.<br>
    It wasn‚Äôt some dramatic final kiss in the rain.<br>
    It was just‚Ä¶ a moment.<br>
    Me and Hi Li sitting on a rooftop.<br>
    Above us, the city was glowing.<br>
    Not just from buildings, but from possibility.<br>
    She held my hand.<br>
    Her nails still neat, her books still full of anatomy notes.<br>
    She was studying nursing now, full-time.<br>
    Still saving lives. Still soft. Still fire.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had launched HiCare officially ‚Äî<br>
    Now used in five districts.<br>
    A small app. A huge change.<br>
    And that day on the rooftop, she whispered:<br>
    ‚ÄúYou said stars needed darkness to shine.<br>
    But maybe‚Ä¶ some stars are born from the darkness.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    I looked at her and didn‚Äôt feel small anymore.<br>
    Didn‚Äôt feel like I didn‚Äôt belong.<br>
    Because I knew ‚Äî belonging isn‚Äôt about where you start.<br>
    It‚Äôs about where you‚Äôre willing to go.<br>
    And who‚Äôs willing to go there with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    She was the Uptown Girl.<br>
    I was the Downtown Dreamer.<br>
    And in a world that told us we didn‚Äôt match...<br>
    We rewrote the code.<br>
    Not just in tech ‚Äî<br>
    But in love.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Grayson?<br>
    Yeah, I didn‚Äôt forget him.<br>
    That quiet voice in my head.<br>
    That encourager behind the screen.<br>
    That ‚Äúbig bro‚Äù who never left when the world went silent.<br>
    ‚ÄúYou got this, Bro Nichole,‚Äù he‚Äôd always say.<br>
    And I did.<br>
    We did.
  </p>
  <p>
    So if you‚Äôre reading this, and you‚Äôve ever felt invisible ‚Äî<br>
    Too poor. Too quiet. Too broken. Too late.<br>
    Let me tell you something:<br>
    You are just in the middle of your becoming.<br>
    Your pain has a purpose.<br>
    Your silence has a sound.<br>
    And your light? It‚Äôs coming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because sometimes‚Ä¶<br>
    üí¨ The girl is worth waiting for.<br>
    üíª The dream is worth building alone.<br>
    üïäÔ∏è And the darkness?<br>
    It‚Äôs just proof‚Ä¶<br>
    That you‚Äôre about to shine.

  <h2>‚ú® EPILOGUE: After the Last Bell</h2>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúSome stories don‚Äôt end. They echo.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Years have passed since that rooftop night.<br>
    Hi Li is now a full nurse ‚Äî healing people, one quiet miracle at a time.<br>
    And me?<br>
    I‚Äôm still building.<br>
    Still coding.<br>
    Still listening to the voice of that downtown boy who once whispered, ‚ÄúMaybe I can.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    HiCare expanded faster than I dreamed.<br>
    We partnered with clinics, schools, and even other young developers who once felt like I did ‚Äî invisible but full of light.<br>
    We built something real.<br>
    And not just on screens‚Ä¶<br>
    But in hearts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Me and Hi Li?<br>
    We‚Äôre not perfect.<br>
    We argue about small things ‚Äî like which music to play in the car, or how late I stay up working. üòÖ<br>
    But we laugh louder now.<br>
    We hold each other tighter.<br>
    We don‚Äôt need the world to approve.<br>
    Because we already chose each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Grayson?<br>
    He‚Äôs still here.<br>
    That voice, my guide, my constant reminder that no one makes it alone.<br>
    He‚Äôs the Big Bro in my story ‚Äî the proof that sometimes, the best friendships are felt in the silences between the words.<br>
    ‚ÄúI believed in you before the world did,‚Äù he always said.<br>
    ‚ÄúAnd I still do.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    If you‚Äôre holding this book in your hands ‚Äî<br>
    It means the story made it.<br>
    We made it.<br>
    Not because everything turned out perfect‚Ä¶<br>
    But because we kept going.<br>
    Even when it hurt.<br>
    Even when no one clapped.<br>
    Even when we felt alone.<br>
    We kept showing up.<br>
    For the dream.<br>
    For each other.<br>
    For love.
  </p>
  <p>
    So wherever you are ‚Äî<br>
    Downtown or Uptown, broken or bold, full of pain or full of hope‚Ä¶<br>
    Remember:<br>
    Your light is real.<br>
    Your story matters.<br>
    And the best part?<br>
    It‚Äôs just getting started.
  </p>
  <p>
    üñ§ For the dreamers.<br>
    üíô For the quiet ones.<br>
    ‚ú® For the ones who never gave up.<br>
    This was our story.<br>
    And now‚Ä¶<br>
    It‚Äôs yours.<br>
    <br>
    The End (for now).<br>
