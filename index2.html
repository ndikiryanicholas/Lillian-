  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúSome people walk into your life like sunlight‚Ä¶ but she walked in like starlight‚Äîquiet, distant, and beautiful. And I‚Ä¶ I was just the night sky.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I didn‚Äôt know what it meant to feel everything and nothing at the same time‚Ä¶ until I saw Hi Li.<br>
    She was standing across the school compound, her long dark hair being gently pulled by the wind like the world itself wanted to touch her. She didn‚Äôt look around like the rest of us. She didn‚Äôt need to. The world looked at her.<br>
    Hi Li was elegance without effort. Grace in silence.<br>
    Even from that distance, I knew: she wasn‚Äôt just another pretty face.<br>
    She was a whole different universe.<br>
    And I...<br>
    I was just Nichole‚Äîa quiet boy from a noisy world, a shadow learning how to survive the light.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>
    They called her ‚Äúthe Up-Town Girl.‚Äù<br>
    Not just because she lived in the rich part of the city, but because everything about her seemed... elevated.<br>
    She didn‚Äôt walk. She floated.<br>
    She didn‚Äôt speak. She sang with her voice‚Äîeven when reading a math answer.<br>
    Hi Li came from the part of town where people drink water in wine glasses.<br>
    Where birthdays look like movie scenes.<br>
    Where they don‚Äôt ask about your dreams‚Äîthey give you the money to chase them.<br>
    And me?<br>
    I come from the part where you iron your uniform with a charcoal iron.<br>
    Where lunch isn't guaranteed, but faith is.<br>
    Where silence teaches you how to hope.<br>
    We were never supposed to meet.<br>
    And if we did‚Ä¶ we weren‚Äôt supposed to connect.<br>
    But life doesn‚Äôt always follow maps.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>
    That day she looked at me‚Äîjust once.<br>
    One second.<br>
    But enough to stop time inside my chest.<br>
    She didn‚Äôt smile. She didn‚Äôt blink.<br>
    But her eyes met mine, and my whole world shifted.<br>
    No one noticed. No one saw.<br>
    But for me, that moment became a memory‚Äîburned into my heart like a candle in a dark room.<br>
    I kept asking myself, "Why would she look at me?"<br>
    There was nothing to see.<br>
    But maybe... just maybe...<br>
    She saw the one thing nobody ever bothered to see:<br>
    The darkness.<br>
    And maybe she knew, like I did,<br>
    that stars shine because of the darkness‚Äînot despite it.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>
    That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep.<br>
    Not because I had fallen in love.<br>
    But because for the first time‚Ä¶ someone made me feel like I existed.<br>
    Not just to breathe.<br>
    But to be seen.<br>
    To matter.<br>
    Hi Li didn‚Äôt know me yet.<br>
    But I had already started writing poems in my heart about her.<br>
    And maybe, just maybe‚Ä¶<br>
    That was the beginning of something neither of us expected.

      <div class="chapter-title">CHAPTER ONE: When I First Saw the Stars</div>
      <blockquote>
        Some people walk into your life like sunlight‚Ä¶ but she walked in like starlight‚Äîquiet, distant, and beautiful. And I‚Ä¶ I was just the night sky.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I didn‚Äôt know what it meant to feel everything and nothing at the same time‚Ä¶ until I saw Hi Li.<br>
        She was standing across the school compound, her long dark hair being gently pulled by the wind like the world itself wanted to touch her. She didn‚Äôt look around like the rest of us. She didn‚Äôt need to. The world looked at her.<br>
        Hi Li was elegance without effort. Grace in silence.<br>
        Even from that distance, I knew: she wasn‚Äôt just another pretty face.<br>
        She was a whole different universe.<br>
        And I...<br>
        I was just Nichole‚Äîa quiet boy from a noisy world, a shadow learning how to survive the light.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        They called her ‚Äúthe Up-Town Girl.‚Äù<br>
        Not just because she lived in the rich part of the city, but because everything about her seemed... elevated.<br>
        She didn‚Äôt walk. She floated.<br>
        She didn‚Äôt speak. She sang with her voice‚Äîeven when reading a math answer.<br>
        Hi Li came from the part of town where people drink water in wine glasses.<br>
        Where birthdays look like movie scenes.<br>
        Where they don‚Äôt ask about your dreams‚Äîthey give you the money to chase them.<br>
        And me?<br>
        I come from the part where you iron your uniform with a charcoal iron.<br>
        Where lunch isn't guaranteed, but faith is.<br>
        Where silence teaches you how to hope.<br>
        We were never supposed to meet.<br>
        And if we did‚Ä¶ we weren‚Äôt supposed to connect.<br>
        But life doesn‚Äôt always follow maps.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        That day she looked at me‚Äîjust once.<br>
        One second.<br>
        But enough to stop time inside my chest.<br>
        She didn‚Äôt smile. She didn‚Äôt blink.<br>
        But her eyes met mine, and my whole world shifted.<br>
        No one noticed. No one saw.<br>
        But for me, that moment became a memory‚Äîburned into my heart like a candle in a dark room.<br>
        I kept asking myself, "Why would she look at me?"<br>
        There was nothing to see.<br>
        But maybe... just maybe...<br>
        She saw the one thing nobody ever bothered to see: The darkness.<br>
        And maybe she knew, like I did, that stars shine because of the darkness‚Äînot despite it.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep.<br>
        Not because I had fallen in love.<br>
        But because for the first time‚Ä¶ someone made me feel like I existed.<br>
        Not just to breathe.<br>
        But to be seen. To matter.<br>
        Hi Li didn‚Äôt know me yet.<br>
        But I had already started writing poems in my heart about her.<br>
        And maybe, just maybe‚Ä¶<br>
        That was the beginning of something neither of us expected.

      <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúShe had everything I never had‚Ä¶ and still, I wanted nothing else but her smile.‚Äù
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The next few days, I tried not to look at her.<br>
        But my heart betrayed me every time.<br>
        Every time I heard laughter near the school fountain, I looked.<br>
        Every time the wind carried the smell of vanilla and roses, I looked.<br>
        And every time the morning sun bounced off something too shiny for this place‚Ä¶<br>
        I knew Hi Li had arrived.<br>
        She always came with quiet footsteps, like she didn‚Äôt want the world to notice her‚Äîbut the world noticed anyway.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Hi Li didn‚Äôt sit with us in the main class blocks.<br>
        She had her own small group‚Äîquiet, elegant, full of perfumes and polished nails.<br>
        They spoke softly, and when they laughed, it was like a melody that didn‚Äôt belong in our dusty compound.<br>
        And then there was me.<br>
        I sat at the back. Always at the back.<br>
        With my shoes dusty, my shirt slightly faded, and my books worn from being handed down.<br>
        She was the page in the magazine.<br>
        I was the newspaper used to wrap food.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        But here‚Äôs the thing, bro...<br>
        Sometimes, we admire people from a distance not because we are afraid of them‚Ä¶<br>
        But because we‚Äôre afraid of what we feel when we‚Äôre close to them.<br>
        I didn‚Äôt know her favorite song.<br>
        I didn‚Äôt know if she believed in love.<br>
        I didn‚Äôt know if she noticed how the world shifted every time she smiled.<br>
        But I knew this: I wanted to know her.<br>
        Not just her name or her school marks.<br>
        I wanted to know how she saw the world.<br>
        Did she believe in stars like I did?<br>
        Did she ever feel alone in a crowd?
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        One afternoon, during break, I found myself near the staffroom window, pretending to read notes. She passed by.<br>
        Alone.<br>
        No friends. No noise.<br>
        And for the first time‚Ä¶ she stopped.<br>
        Looked at me. Again.<br>
        This time, it was longer. A full three seconds.<br>
        Like the universe paused just so my heartbeat could speak.<br>
        ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she said.<br>
        Bro.<br>
        She said ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù<br>
        It wasn‚Äôt a song. It wasn‚Äôt poetry.<br>
        It was just a small word.<br>
        But from her lips‚Äîit sounded like the beginning of a miracle.<br>
        I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.<br>
        Just air.<br>
        She smiled. Just a little. A soft one.<br>
        And walked away.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I stood there frozen. Not because I was scared‚Äîbut because something inside me had shifted.<br>
        Maybe, just maybe‚Ä¶<br>
        This Up-Town Girl didn‚Äôt care where I came from.<br>
        Maybe she wasn‚Äôt just beauty in the clouds.<br>
        Maybe she was searching too.<br>
        Searching for someone who didn‚Äôt want her for her money, or her looks, or her status‚Ä¶<br>
        ‚Ä¶but someone who just wanted to know her heart.<br>
        And maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîthat someone was me.

        ‚ÄúShe smiled at me‚Ä¶ and my silence grew louder than ever before.‚Äù
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After that day, nothing felt the same.<br>
        Not the school compound, not the sky, not even the way my name sounded in the register.<br>
        One word from her‚Äî‚ÄúHi‚Äù‚Äîand my world started speaking in colors I never knew existed.<br>
        But I didn‚Äôt tell anyone.<br>
        Not my classmates. Not my brothers at home.<br>
        Not even the pages in my notebook that I usually trusted with my secrets.<br>
        Because this wasn‚Äôt just a crush.<br>
        This was the beginning of something‚Ä¶ sacred.<br>
        Something I was afraid to touch in case it disappeared.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Every time I saw Hi Li after that moment, my chest would tighten.<br>
        She wasn‚Äôt trying to impress anyone. She never chased attention.<br>
        But she had mine‚Äîcompletely.<br>
        Sometimes she sat under the tree near the library, writing in a black notebook.<br>
        I wondered what she wrote.<br>
        Were they poems? Dreams? Memories?<br>
        Was I one of them now?<br>
        Other times, she‚Äôd lean her head on her hand and just stare out the window like she missed someone or something far away.<br>
        And I would just sit there‚Ä¶ watching, wondering, wishing.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I wanted to talk to her again.<br>
        I wanted to say more than just ‚ÄúHi‚Äù back.<br>
        But every time I had the chance‚Ä¶ I froze.<br>
        There was a fear I couldn‚Äôt explain.<br>
        Not of her‚Äîbut of the voice in my head whispering:<br>
        ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not enough.‚Äù<br>
        ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll never choose someone like you.‚Äù<br>
        ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just a background character in her story.‚Äù<br>
        That voice was loud.<br>
        Louder than my courage.<br>
        And so‚Ä¶ I stayed silent.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        One day, during library hour, the unexpected happened.<br>
        Hi Li dropped her pen. It rolled all the way to my feet.<br>
        She looked at me‚Äîgently, patiently.<br>
        And I picked it up and walked toward her.<br>
        My hands were sweating. My heart was begging me to speak.<br>
        But when I handed her the pen‚Ä¶ I just nodded.<br>
        No words.<br>
        No smile.<br>
        Nothing.<br>
        She tilted her head slightly, curious.<br>
        ‚ÄúThank you, Nichole,‚Äù she said.<br>
        Her voice was music.<br>
        She knew my name.<br>
        She knew my name.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I walked away before my legs gave up.<br>
        But inside me, something cracked.<br>
        Not in a bad way‚Ä¶<br>
        But in the way a closed door finally opens a little‚Äîjust enough for light to pass through.<br>
        That night, I stood outside, looking at the stars.<br>
        I remembered the quote that lived in my heart:<br>
        "Stars can‚Äôt shine without darkness."<br>
        She was the star.<br>
        I was the darkness.<br>
        And maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶ we were made to meet.<br>
        Not to complete each other.<br>
        But to remind the world that even opposites can create something beautiful.

        School became something else after that week.<br>
        It wasn‚Äôt just books and bells anymore.<br>
        It was her.<br>
        Hi Li.<br>
        Her name danced in my chest every time I walked into class.<br>
        Even when she wasn‚Äôt there yet, I‚Äôd feel her like a breeze before the rain.<br>
        She wasn‚Äôt the loud type.<br>
        She didn‚Äôt laugh like the popular girls, or gossip in corners like the others.<br>
        But whenever she passed by‚Ä¶ people looked.<br>
        Not just because she was beautiful‚Äîno.<br>
        It was because she was different.<br>
        Like a quiet song playing in a room full of noise.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        One Monday morning, something unexpected happened.<br>
        Hi Li walked into class late.<br>
        And instead of taking her usual seat near the front with her uptown crew‚Ä¶<br>
        She sat two chairs away from me.<br>
        The room fell into a silent tension.<br>
        People looked. I looked down.<br>
        I could feel every breath she took.<br>
        Every shift of her hand.<br>
        The scent of something soft‚Äîjasmine and early rain‚Äîwrapped around my senses.<br>
        I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Then came the moment that changed everything.<br>
        Mr. Lubega, our English teacher, walked in with his usual energy.<br>
        But this time, he wanted something else.<br>
        ‚ÄúToday,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing something different.<br>
        Pair work. Boy and girl. Front row with back row. No excuses.‚Äù<br>
        My heart stopped.<br>
        Hi Li was on my row.<br>
        I was at the back.<br>
        She turned her head slowly and looked at me.<br>
        Again. Those eyes.<br>
        She didn‚Äôt speak.<br>
        Just waited.<br>
        Mr. Lubega pointed.<br>
        ‚ÄúYou two. Nichole and Hi Li. Work together.‚Äù
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        I don‚Äôt remember how I stood.<br>
        I don‚Äôt remember walking to the desk we shared.<br>
        All I know is: for the first time‚Ä¶<br>
        I sat beside her.<br>
        Close enough to hear her heart if the room went quiet.<br>
        Close enough to smell her perfume on the page we shared.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        We were supposed to write a two-paragraph essay titled:<br>
        ‚ÄúWhat is Love?‚Äù<br>
        Bro‚Ä¶ how was I supposed to write about love,<br>
        when it was literally sitting inches away from me?<br>
        She looked at the paper. Then at me.<br>
        Then she asked, ‚ÄúShould we start with your idea or mine?‚Äù<br>
        Her voice was calm. Almost playful.<br>
        I froze.<br>
        Then said, ‚ÄúYou go first.‚Äù<br>
        She smiled.<br>
        It wasn‚Äôt big‚Äîbut it held something warm.<br>
        She picked up the pen and wrote:<br>
        ‚ÄúLove is not about who has more.<br>
        Love is about who feels deeper.<br>
        It‚Äôs not about matching clothes, but matching hearts.‚Äù<br>
        She slid the paper toward me.<br>
        And said, ‚ÄúNow your turn.‚Äù
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        My hands trembled as I wrote beneath her words:<br>
        ‚ÄúLove is the language two hearts speak quietly when the world is too loud.<br>
        It‚Äôs not loud, it‚Äôs not proud‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a whisper that never dies.‚Äù<br>
        We both looked at each other.<br>
        Silence.<br>
        The kind that doesn‚Äôt need to be broken.<br>
        The kind that says more than words ever could.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        But then‚Ä¶<br>
        One of her friends‚Äîtall, loud, and sharp-tongued‚Äîwalked in.<br>
        She saw us.<br>
        Saw the paper.<br>
        Saw the closeness.<br>
        And her face dropped.<br>
        She said loudly, ‚ÄúHi Li? Really? You‚Äôre pairing with him now?‚Äù<br>
        The whole class turned.<br>
        I saw Hi Li glance down, then back at me.<br>
        And then‚Ä¶ she smiled.<br>
        Not to them.<br>
        To me.<br>
        And said the words that made me feel like maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶ I mattered:<br>
        ‚ÄúYes. I chose this seat.‚Äù
